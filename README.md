### Overview
The **ISAW AI Librarian** is an end-to-end pipeline tailored for humanities scholars. It enables:
1. **Data Collection**: Scraping and downloading scholarly articles from online sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Splitting text into manageable chunks with metadata.
3. **Knowledge Augmentation**: Creating an augmented retrieval system to query domain-specific knowledge.
4. **User Interface**: Deploying a user-friendly interface to retrieve and explore insights from the data.

This tool is specifically designed for researchers working in domains like history, archaeology, and related fields, facilitating easy access to their data and enhanced information retrieval.

### Features
- **Web Scraping**: Automatically download scholarly PDFs from web pages.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Split long texts into manageable, metadata-tagged chunks for efficient storage and querying.
- **Text Embedding and Search**: Create a searchable database using advanced vector-based embeddings.
- **QA Chat Interface**: Use an interactive Gradio interface for querying domain-specific knowledge, with options to refine queries and retrieve sources.

### How It Works
#### Pipeline Overview
1. **Data Collection**: Download scholarly articles from URLs.
2. **Chunking**: Split documents into manageable chunks, retaining metadata like source URLs and page numbers.
3. **Embedding**: Convert text into embeddings using `OpenAIEmbeddings` for similarity-based search.
4. **Query Interface**: Implement an AI-powered librarian using `langchain` to answer questions and retrieve information interactively.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/isaw-ai-librarian.git
   cd isaw_ai_librarian
   
2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set up environment variables for OpenAI API:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

## User Interface
The Gradio-powered interface offers:

- **Textbox**: For asking questions or inputting research summaries.
- **Refinement Options**: Use checkboxes for domain-specific perspectives like "Art History" or "Archaeology."
- **Multilingual Support**: Receive responses in English, Mandarin, Arabic, Spanish, or Russian.
