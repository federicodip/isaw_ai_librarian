Unfortunately, the date of composition of the tablets is not known. The presence of the zodiac indicates that they must date to after the development of the zodiac in the late fifth century ,4 and the scribes use of the old form of the number 9 (written with nine vertical wedges stacked in three rows of three) alongside the later cursive form (written with three winkelhaken placed in a diagonal line) is suggestive of a date in the fifth or fourth century , but a later date cannot be ruled out.#p1In the following we review the principal evidence from Greek, Latin, and Egyptian astrological sources for the various systems of Terms and their origin, and then discuss the sections of BM 36326 and BM 36628+36817+37197 which preserve details of the terms, concluding with a consideration of their relationship with the Greco-Roman and Egyptian tradition.

    "Such a detailed scheme was surely transmitted by the aid of written texts, not merely oral instruction.#p55Situating the system's origin in Babylonia rather than Egypt puts the question of the principles of its organization in a new perspective; and the variants in the sequence and length of the Terms, which are most plausibly to be explained as the result of changes introduced after the transmission, imply that the answer is likely to be too complicated to recover unless a more nearly complete text of the Babylonian version becomes available.

    "The traditional claims, reported with scepticism by Ptolemy, that the system was constructed around the lordships of the Houses, Triplicities, and Exaltations, is cast into doubt, since the lordships of the Houses depend on a Greek cosmology, while those of the Triplicities have not as yet turned up in cuneiform sources and perhaps derive in part from the House lordships.In this light it is noteworthy that one of the changes in order of planets gave Mercury the lordship of the first Term of Virgo, in which sign it has both House lordship and exaltation.

    "This change, at least, looks like a deliberate attempt to bring the system into closer harmony with the other lordships.We still lack a satisfactory explanation for the original order of planets, and in particular the reasons behind assigning the first Terms of Cancer, Libra, and Scorpio to the malefic planets.The original lengths of the terms, and the various changes to them introduced in the Greek version, also remain unexplained, and we do not know at what stage or in what manner their totals were connected with the doctrine of maximum lifespans.#p56Setting aside these questions of technical detail, the most interesting outcome of the discovery of the Babylonian lists of Terms is the realization that the Babylonian origin of the Egyptian scheme could have been forgotten or suppressed in the Greek tradition, and moreover that it came to be strongly associated with Egyptian sages of old, in contrast to an allegedly Chaldean system that, up to the present, has not turned up in cuneiform sources.41 During the Hellenistic period, astrological prognostication was strongly associated with Babylonians or Chaldeans, and many of its first practitioners in the Greco-Roman world were undoubtedly of genuine Near Eastern derivation or were trained by scholars belonging to the Mesopotamian tradition.

    "By the 230s precious metal coins had largely disappeared from the chu00f4ra, and exchange between silver and bronze currency became a matter of negotiation and local policy, apparently controlled by royal banks.Monetization was uneven and in the chu00f4ra it could only be maintained by an extensive system of credit.Under these circumstances prices were not sensitive to money supply, so that the inflation of the late third century cannot be explained by an oversupply of coinage or a shortage of goods. (This conclusion ignores the current tendency of economists to consider credit as part of the money supply and the recent painful lessens that credit can indeed lead to price inflation.) Von Reden critically reviews the documentary evidence for the inflation of the late third century and suggests that the disappearance of monopoly banks (responsible for money changing) after the reign of Ptolemy III and of the salt tax after 217 may have contributed to a piecemeal disintegration of the monetary system under Ptolemy IV, which culminated in the removal of most bronze coinage from circulation.

A relatively recent paper went so far as to suggest as a rule of thumb that we should not study samples with fewer than twenty observations when faced with two variables, including the constant.24 Without entering into technical niceties, the main issue is that few available parameters do not allow the error term in the equation to sufficiently converge towards the true term, implying a significant loss of information.#p19Even when statistical quality may seem on the surface to be satisfactory, the results might differ from what a larger sample would produce.

    "Although one may argue, with some justification, that Cicero (in the midst of a trial) and Polybius (because of his accuracy) are to be followed, it is quite clear that prices derived from literary sources are of a different nature from prices provided by primary materials recording real transactions.#p25The case of the Lusitanian price is illustrative: the relevant fragment of Polybiuss Histories has been transmitted through the later 2nd-century Alexandrian sophist Athenaeus.

    "The price of barley is given as 1 drachma and the price of wheat as 9 Alexandrine obols.30 The word Alexandrine is a cause of concern, since it is highly unlikely that the Achaean Polybius would have used the Ptolemaic currency, whose use was restricted to Egypt, to translate a grain price in Cisalpine Gaul while addressing an aristocratic Greco-Roman audience.#p26Athenaeus might have turned Polybiuss 9 (Attic) obols into 9 Alexandrine (Ptolemaic) obols, knowing that the Egyptian currency was at that time locally translated at par against other Hellenistic coinage.31 In that case we have 1 medimnos = 1.5 drachma = 1.5 denarius = 6 sestertii.

    "Then the modius is worth slightly over 1 sestertius, since 6 modii are a little over 1 medimnos.Alternatively, 9 Alexandrine (Ptolemaic) obols could be equated with 7.5 to 8 Attic obols after taking into account their lower silver content, and the modius would have been worth a figure close to HS 0.85 This is evidently the solution chosen by Rickman, since he writes just less than 1 sesterce a modius.32 As such, this is the figure that Kessler and Temin use.#p27However, if Athenaeus is paraphrasing Polybius and using the drachma and obol of the Roman Egypt that he and his audience knew, then 9 Alexandrian obols simply means HS 1.5 in the 2nd century , i.e., 3/8 denarius for a medimnos, since at that time 1 Attic drachma = 1 denarius = 4 sestertii = 4 Alexandrian drachmas.

    "In that case, Polybius would have originally written 2.25 (Attic) obols and Athenaeus would have translated this into something more customary to his Alexandrian readers, provided he was aware of the way these different monetary systems were translated into one another.If this is correct, the price of a modius of wheat in Lusitania in the 2nd century could have been as low as HS 0.25 instead of slightly below HS 1.#p28But the question is still not exhausted, for when Polybius was writing, the Romans modified their currency system and the denarius was revalued from 10 asses to 16 asses in c. 141 33 Since Polybius once approximates 1 obol with 2 asses,34 it is quite likely that he uses the pre-141 system where the sestertius was worth not 4 asses but 2.5 asses.

    "As the sestertius remained a quarter of a denarius, this does not change the price translation computed by Rickman.Nevertheless, it is legitimate to question whether actual prices in copper currency did not rise by 60% during the years following the moment when the value of the denarius had been adjusted upward by 60% vs. the as.This would undermine the comparative character of the prices stated by Polybius just before the monetary reform.#p29It is possible that the Roman authorities adjusted their bimetallic monetary system to the actual market rate of exchange between their silver and copper currency at that time.35 The price computed by Rickman could thus be correct.

    "To quote Rickman: It is possible that by the end of the Republic and the early Empire, the price of grain in Rome had risen to a regular level of 5 or even 6 sesterces a modius. As far as Egyptian prices are concerned, Rathbone argues for broad stability between the later first century and 160.Then his argument develops further, since even the prices attested before 50 mostly fall within the later normal band, but they may represent a lower band of prices.#p38Even that cautious assumption of a rise is potentially challengeable by the uncertainties surrounding the rate of exchange between the later Ptolemaic and early Imperial Egyptian drachma and the Imperial currency.

    "We will come back to that topic.#p39For the sake of argument, let us nevertheless maintain the Roman price increase as assumed by Temin and Kessler.There remain three prices that they use outside Rome that need some obvious revision: those from Palestine, the Fayyum, and Antioch in Pisidia.#p40Equation instability with two prices adjustmentAs previously seen, Palestines prices were most likely closer to HS 4 than 2-2.5 per modius.

    "As far as Egypt is concerned, HS 1.5 seems significantly too low: a figure closer to 2 is preferable.43 This view is reinforced by the specificity of Egyptian sources: most of the time, they are part of estate accounts, whereas literary evidence and administrative injunctions originating from other provinces of the Empire normally deal with local consumption prices. A sales margin or at least some transportation costs must have frequently separated prices measured on estates and local consumption centers.44 Knowing actual transaction prices for wheat in Oxyrhynchus, Tebtunis or Karanis would suppress that source of heterogeneity.

    "We have unfortunately no such evidence.Finally, in the case of Antioch, we must correct what is probably a typographical mistake in the Pisidian price used by Kessler and Temin.The prices provided by the Prefects edict are HS 2 and 2.25.The difference between a Roman price in a range of HS 5 to 6 and that in Pisidia should be HS 3.375 and not 3.13 (they meant 3.125).45#p41The relationship we obtain with these modified data displays a slope coefficient (u03b2) that is -0.00044 instead of -0.001, which is not surprising since moving the Pisidian, the Egyptian and Palestine prices all closer to the Roman prices brings more horizontality to the sample of variables.

    "In simple words, distance and prices could be irrelevant to each other.#p42At this stage, this does not mean the relationship advocated by Kessler and Temin is necessarily wrong; rather, it is essentially unstable and highly dependent on how a handful of sources are interpreted.This is particularly true of the Judean price: multiplying it by a factor of two effectively destroys the relationship.

    "In that respect we need to keep in mind that Sperbers work postdates by several decades Heichelheims contribution to Franks ESAR and that his mastery of ancient Jewish sources goes far deeper.Since changing the Judean grain price is sufficient to potentially render the equation irrelevant, we are then exactly in the same situation we described for the post-war S&P 500, where alteration in one unique parameter could kill a numerical relationship.#p43It is then a true methodological weakness to write, We assume that the prices we observe are drawn from a distribution of prices in the early Roman Empire.47 The reality is that some of these prices are prices, some are testimonies, but some are uncertain reconstructions, and as such may be neither random nor normative.#p44Thus the equation supporting a market-oriented interpretation of the Roman economy could be the product of pure luck or, worse, careful data selection.

    "Still we may question whether or not Roman prices did jump by as much as 50% between the late Republican period and Imperial times, as assumed by Kessler and Temin.One clue could come from comparing the various Roman grain subsidies.The Gracchans scheme had provided the modius at a low price of 6.33 asses (HS 1.58) in 124 161 During the Empire, we have two known interventions on wheat prices during periods of hardship: one under Tiberius, where prices are fixed at some unspecified level while HS 2 per modius are given to the merchants as a recompense; later, Nero imposed a price of HS 3 after the great fire.

    "Scientific InvestigationsThere have been three major X-ray studies of the Antikythera Mechanism since the early 1970s.6 In addition, the National Archaeological Museum in Athens has undertaken X-ray studies of some individual fragments.Historically, many of the most important scientific developments have come from X-ray investigations.The most recent scientific data gathering was undertaken in 2005 by the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project (AMRP)u2014an informal collaboration of academics from the universities of Cardiff, Athens and Thessaloniki; staff at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens; and two high-technology companies, Hewlett-Packard (USA) and X-Tek Systems (UK) (now part of Nikon Metrology).#p6Two non-destructive investigatory techniques were used: Polynomial Texture Mapping (PTM) to enhance surface details of the fragments and Microfocus X-ray Computed Tomography (X-ray CT) to examine the interiors of the fragments at high resolution.7 PTM enables a sample to be interactively re-lit in software to enhance the surface.

A central dial system displayed outputs from the Mechanism on a Zodiac Dial, marked with 360u00ba scale divisions and a Calendar Dial, marked with 365 days.The Calendar Dial was designed to be moveable, so that the Mechanism could accommodate the fact that four Egyptian calendar years fall short of four 365.25 day solar years by one day.10 Above and below the dials, were plates covered in inscriptions in the form of a Parapegma (star calendar).11 At the right-hand side of the Mechanism there was an input, and we assume that this was turned by hand with some sort of handle or crank, though only the keyway for the input remains.

    "Overview of the New Model One of the key questions that arises from the Cosmos theory about the front face of the Mechanism is whether mechanisms for all five planets can realistically be included, using similar design and mechanical principles to those found in the surviving gear trains.The first person to interpret the Mechanism's fragments as the remains of a planetarium and to propose that it displayed the five planets known in antiquity as well as the Sun and Moon was the classicist Albert Rehm, though his prescient research notes, written in 1905-1906, were never published.19 His idea was that the five turns of the dial in Fragment B, which we now call the Upper Back Dial, represe ted the five planets. Source: Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones. The Cosmos in the Antikythera Mechanism. ISAW Papers 4 (February, 2012)",
    "This idea could only make sense prior to 2004, when Wright established that the dial does not consist of concentric rings, but is in fact a spiral.There is now ample evidence that this dial was a 19-year Metonic calendar and had nothing to do with planets.20 In 2002, Wright showed through a working physical reconstruction of the Mechanism that it was possible to include all the planets at its front, though, in our view, at the expense of avoidable complication and insufficient correlation with the evidence from the fragments.21 This modelu2014with its eight coaxial pointers at the front of the Mechanismu2014was a remarkable view of the possible capabilities of ancient Greek technology.

    "It was an exercise in showing what might have been possible: essentially a demonstration of principle.We discuss this model in more detail in 3.5.This present study aims to show how all five planets can be included in the Antikythera Mechanism in a way that conforms to the observed data and explains several puzzling pieces of evidence that have been previously unresolved.The solution is economical and elegant and is in complete harmony with the design virtuosity that has already been uncovered in the existing gear trains.

    "Despite the lack of physical evidence in the form of surviving gears, we believe that the close match of our model with other physical evidence as well as its intimate conceptual association with the known gear trains create a compelling case that this was in essence the way that the Mechanism was originally constructed.The inferior planets are those whose orbits are inside the Earths orbitu2014namely Mercury and Venus. Source: Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones. The Cosmos in the Antikythera Mechanism. ISAW Papers 4 (February, 2012)",
    "The superior planets have orbits outside the Earths.Those known in ancient times were Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.All the planets appear from the Earth to orbit nonuniformly, with a periodic alternation of prograde and retrograde motion.Ancient Greek models of planetary motion prior to Ptolemy were based on the idea that these anomalistic motions could, at least in first approximation, be modelled using a combination of two circular motionsu2014the so-called deferent-and-epicycle and eccentre models.22 This theory apparently originated in the early second century BC with Apollonios of Perga and his contemporaries, though an earlier date cannot be ruled out.23 Using these ideas, the motions of the inferior planets can be mechanized fairly easily with just two gearsu2014a fixed gear on the central axis and an epicyclic gear that engages with this fixed gearu2014combined with a pin and slotted follower.24 The superior planets have proved more difficult to model in a way that fits the mechanical constraints of the Mechanisms design.

    "Our reconstruction proposes mechanisms for the superior planets based on the known mechanization of the lunar anomaly at the back of the Antikythera Mechanism.Surprisingly, these models look exactly the same as the lunar anomaly mechanism.They have just four gears, including an epicyclic gear with a pin on its face and a second epicyclic gear, which rotates on an eccentric epicyclic axis and has a slot in its face that engages with the pin.

    "They provide an elegant solution to the long-standing problem of how the superior planets might have been shown in the Antikythera Mechanism.It is noteworthy that similar mechanisms can serve both to model the lunar anomaly and the synodic phases of the planets.Though the physical evidence is sparse due to the great loss of material in the fragments, our new model explains the existence of bearings and fittings on the Main Drive Wheel, b1, as well as the mysterious pillars attached to its circumference.25 The model also accounts for the dimensions of the pillars.

    "All of our planetary mechanisms are contained in the space in front of b1 that is defined by the support pillarsu2014a circumstance that could also help explain how all the planetary gearing could have fallen out before the Mechanism's rediscovery.It is surprising that all these mechanisms can be crammed into the relatively small space in front of b1.Price proposed this nearly forty years ago, without any details as to how it might be accomplished.26 Alternatively there is a possibility that this space... may have held a gearing system, now totally vanished, which served to exhibit the rotations of all of the planets other than the Sun and Moon.

    "If such gearing was to be part of the device it would be most appropriate at this place where annual and monthly rotations were available just under the front dial plate.It is not clear to us why the monthly rotation might be relevant to the planets, but the rest of this idea is preserved in our model.Our model also retains the simplicity in the outward design of the Mechanism as a rectangular box that Price proposed.

    "As previously mentioned, Wright has demonstrated the feasibility of including all five planets in the Antikythera Mechanism using essentially the same technology and engineering that we see in the surviving fragments.We discuss this important model later in 3.5.In Wright's model, the solar anomaly was mechanized as well.In the light of the subsequent discovery of the mechanization of the lunar anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism, we believe that it was very likely that the solar anomaly was also included. A recent careful study has demonstrated that the graduation of at least one of the two extant front dial rings, the Egyptian calendar ring and the zodiac ring, had a small apparently systematic nonuniformity, which can be explained as a deliberate nonuniform spacing of the degrees on the zodiac ring so that a uniformly revolving mean Sun pointer would simultaneously indicate both the true Sun's longitude and the Egyptian calendar date.27 On this hypothesis, the motion of pointers representing the motions of the Moon and planets would incorporate a solar anomaly component (a not inconceivable notion, though contrary to known ancient theories) unless the pointers revolved around an eccentric axis.

    "An alternative planetary display also explored in that study hypothesizes that there were no pointers for the planets revolving around the zodiac dial, but instead a system of five subsidiary dials with uniformly revolving pointers indicating the planets' synodic cycles.We believe that the inscriptional evidence examined below rules out such subsidiary dials.Moreover, the division of circles into ostensibly equal arcs elsewhere in the Mechanism is sometimes evidently nonuniform, for example in the spacing of teeth on gears,28 the holes for mounting the Egyptian calendar dial,29 and the divisions of the Saros eclipse dial, as we have confirmed from observations of the X-ray CT data.

    "The solar pointer is marked by a little golden sphere (as mentioned in the Back Cover Inscription, 2.3.2) and the planetary pointers with appropriately coloured spheres for the planets.These spheres are placed at distances, which represent their geocentric orbits in the prevailing ancient Greek order of proximity to the Earth: Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.In this way the Cosmos idea is preserved, whilst the lunar phase mechanism has access to the Sun rotation.

    "This evidence is in the form of testimony about similar mechanisms from the classical literature, inscriptions about the planets on the Front and Back Covers, and surviving physical evidence from Fragment 2.2 Astronomical Mechanisms in Classical Literature Allusions to mechanical representations of astronomical phenomena turn up intermittently in ancient Greek and Latin literature; unfortunately most are vague and do not reflect first-hand experience of such devices.31 An important exception is Cicero, who refers in his De Natura Deorum 2.34-35 (87-88) to a mechanism constructed by u2013 or perhaps more plausible to say at the commission of u2013 his philosophical teacher Posidonios in Rhodes, probably in the 80s or 70s BC.

    "Cicero does not say explicitly that he had seen Posidonios' device, but it is likely enough that he had, and in the worst case his direct connection with Posidonios renders it unlikely that his information is inaccurate.All that he tells us, however, is that Posidonios' mechanism translated a single rotary input into a display of the diverse motions of the Sun, Moon, and five planets.The description of the mechanism forms part of an a fortiori philosophical argument for the existence of a divine designer of the cosmos: the claim is that the complexity of the mechanism's displays, though far inferior to that of the real heavens, would suffice to convince any viewer that it had been constructed by an intelligent mind.

    "In this context, any explanation of the concealed mechanical workings of Posidonios' mechanism would have detracted from the analogy he is drawing between it and the cosmos.In two other works, the Tusculan Disputations 1.63 and De Re Publica 1.14 (21-22), Cicero makes similar claims (for the sake of the same argument from design) concerning a mechanical sphaera constructed by Archimedes in the late third century BC.

Source: Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones. The Cosmos in the Antikythera Mechanism. ISAW Papers 4 (February, 2012)",
    "For the planets, the most important set of intervals was the so-called Goal-Year periods, which were used to forecast repetitions of phenomena such as first and last visibilities and stationary points; these are sub-century intervals approximately comprising whole numbers of solar years and whole numbers of a planet's synodic cycles, so that after one Goal-Year period a planet will repeat its phenomena at very nearly the same longitudes. Source: Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones. The Cosmos in the Antikythera Mechanism. ISAW Papers 4 (February, 2012)",
    "Besides the Goal-Year periods, many other approximate periods are attested in Babylonian texts, including longer and more accurate periods (of the order of centuries) that were built up out of the shorter ones to serve as the basis for advanced methods of predicting planetary motion.61 For the purposes of forecasting future occurrences of phenomena one-to-one from observed past occurrences, it sufficed to know the duration of a suitable period for the planet in question without having to take account of the planet's behaviour during the period. Source: Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones. The Cosmos in the Antikythera Mechanism. ISAW Papers 4 (February, 2012)",
    "As a basis for mathematical modelling of a planet's apparent motion, a period relation took the form of an equation of a whole number x of synodic cycles, a whole number z of revolutions of the planet around the ecliptic, and a whole number y of solar years; for example, Saturn's Goal-Year period of 59 years becomes: 57 synodic cycles = 2 longitudinal revolutions = 59 years.Greek astronomers' records of dated planetary observations began only about 300 BC, and were never as systematic as the Babylonian records, so that their knowledge of period relations, beyond the crudest periods, was derived from Babylonian sources; thus we are informed by Ptolemy that Hipparchos, in the mid second century BC, had a set of planetary period relations that we recognize as the Babylonian Goal-Year periods. Source: Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones. The Cosmos in the Antikythera Mechanism. ISAW Papers 4 (February, 2012)",
    "The Greeks also applied observational evidence and mathematical algorithms to obtain other period relations as modifications of the Babylonian ones.In some cases these were more astronomically accurate, but some were preferred for other reasons, for example so that one could have a simultaneous repetition of the phenomena of all the planets in a single vast Great Year period running to tens of thousands of years or more.62 3.2.

    "Geometrical theories of planetary motion During the second century BC, Greek astronomers seeking geometrical models to describe the motions of the Sun, Moon, and planets employed geocentric models that may be described anachronistically as representing a heavenly body's position relative to the Earth as the sum of two uniformly rotating vectors of constant length.63 When a planetary model of this kind is translated into a heliocentric system, one of the vectors turns out to represent the planet's mean revolution around the Sun (i.e. treating its orbit as perfectly circular), and the other represents the negative of the Earth's mean revolution around the Sun.

    "Since the vectors can be added in either order, each body's motion can be effected by two geometrical models that result in identical paths for the body while suggesting distinct physical interpretations.Taking the longer vector as the primary revolution around the Earth, and the shorter vector as a secondary revolution superimposed on the primary revolution, we obtain the deferent and epicycle model, where the body revolves uniformly along an epicyclic circle whose centre revolves uniformly along a deferent circle concentric with the Earth.

    "Reversing the role of the vectors, we obtain the eccentre model, where the body revolves uniformly along a circular orbit that encloses the Earth but is not concentric with it, while the centre of the orbit revolves uniformly around the Earth.Greek astronomers appear to have preferred the deferent and epicycle model for the two inferior planets, Venus and Mercury (see Fig. 26), probably because it gave an intuitive explanation of the fact that these planets alternately run ahead and behind the Sun without ever surpassing a certain maximum elongation from it.

In the epicyclic model, the planet P revolves uniformly in the sense of increasing longitude (counter clockwise as seen from north of the system) around the centre E of the epicycle, while E revolves uniformly in the same sense around the Earth The direction from E to P is identical to the direction of the Mean Sun S from In the kinematically equivalent eccentre model, the planet revolves uniformly in the sense of increasing longitude around the centre C of an eccentric orbit while C revolves uniformly in the same sense about The direction from T to C is identical to the direction of S from Because these models translate into a heliocentric system in which all the planets revolve uniformly on circular orbits concentric with the Sun, they successfully explain the planets' synodic cycles with their alternations of prograde and retrograde motion, but they fail to predict the variations in a planet's successive synodic cycles that result from the fact that the true orbits are not uniform and circular but elliptical and subject to Kepler's Second Lawsource: Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones.

    "Because of the importance of this model, we will examine it in some detail to discuss whether it matches the physical evidence.Images of Wrights Planetarium model can be seen in Wright 2002, pp. 171, 172.Wright observed that b1 turns on a bearing attached to a central pipe, fixed to the Main Plate, which ends in a squared boss.74 He suggests that fixed gears were attached hereu2014and these might very plausibly have been the fixed gears for inferior planetary mechanisms.

    "With this scheme, it is not easy to understand why the wheel had spokes, rather than being a simple disk.Once the inferior planets and the solar anomaly have been added, there is a problem with mechanizing the superior planets.Because the mechanisms already attached to b1 get in the way, a fixed gear for the 0-input cannot be added to the squared boss on axis b and a mean solar input for the 1-input apparently cannot be contributed directly by b1.

    "Wright's model solves these problems, by adding a separate module for each superior planet, where the module is fixed to the side of an extended case for the 0-input and an auxiliary axle provides the 1-input.This axle is at the side of b1 and takes its rotation via a small gear that meshes with b1.This rotation is then transmitted to the planet module via another small gear of equal size and a gear the same size as b1 for each module.

    "In our view, it is a cumbersome arrangement.Indeed Wright has considered ways of dispensing with this arrangement.75 From the 1-input to each superior planet module, gearing calculates the mean rotation of the planet around the Sun, and an epicycle is attached, which is geared to have the rotation of the mean Sun.Hence the module directly models the deferent and epicycle model.Each module uses seven or eight gears for each superior planet, leading to a system of considerable complexity.

    "In 478 BCE, at a time of insecurity after the Persian Wars, the Athenians created a maritime confederacy with Delos as its seat and by the end of the fifth century BCE they resumed the administration of the sanctuary.9 During this period, in 426 BCE, the Athenians purified the island; they removed tombs of all who had died on the island and issued a proclamation that in future none should be born or die on the sacred island; pregnant women and dying persons must be ferried across to Rheneia.10 This important moment marked the character of the urban settlement on Delos and its subsequent growth.

    "We will do the same (and more) in this introduction.The one point that was stressed at LAWDI was stability, particularly of published URIs (and for discussion of the difference between URIs and URLs see Sauerman et al. [2008]).The fundamental practice of giving individual URIs to all discrete resources that a project published was energetically endorsed.Among the types of URIs often used as examples within the study of the ancient world were Pleiades URIs for ancient places (e.g. https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/59672) and the Worldcat catalog stood out as providing common identifiers with impact beyond any single discipline (e.g. http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/768969647).

    "Beyond stability, the faculty and participants at LAWDI both stressed and searched for common vocabularies that can be used to encourage machine readability of the information available at the stable URIs that currently exist and that will become available.The Pelagios Project (Isaksen et al. 2014), which is aggregating disparate uses of Pleiades identifiers, has shown the utility of expressing links between resources in such a way that they can be automatically harvested.

    "Despite an avoidance of excessively technical presentations, LAWDI did not shy away from highlighting the RDF Triple as an important tool in ongoing efforts to encourage interoperability.We likewise think it probably that readers of the current essays will find it useful to be familiar with this fundamental concept in the publication of re-usable data on the public internet.Meaning that we offer here a very brief answer to the question, What is a Triple?.#p5A triple is a statement of information in three parts. Source: Prologue and Introduction.Tom Elliott, Sebastian Heath and John Muccigrosso ISAW Papers 7.1 (2014)",
    "Using colloquial language, those three parts can be defined in the following way:#p6The Subject: The thing being talked about.The Predicate: The category of statement one is making about the subject.The Object: The content of the statement that one is making about the subject.For example, the English sentence Athens is located in Attica has the subject Athens, the predicate located in, and the object Attica.#p7It is best practice in LOD to use URIs for all three elements of a triple so that the following three URIs are a machine readable version of the same sentence:#p8https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/579885http://www.geonames.org/ontology#locatedInhttp://www.geonames.org/6692632Using the triple terminology, clicking on the subject, or first URI in the list, will bring up the Pleiades record for Athens. Source: Prologue and Introduction.Tom Elliott, Sebastian Heath and John Muccigrosso ISAW Papers 7.1 (2014)",
    "Clicking on the predicate will bring up a human-readable introduction to the Geonames vocabulary.And clicking on the object will bring up the geonames.org record for Attica.#p9Showing that one simple English sentence can be transformed into a group of URIs is a prelude to the much grander assertion that triples can express many forms of information.An individual project's database might record object dimensions or site locations in a row and column oriented format that suits its particular needs.

    "If that information is published on the Internet as triples, it is more likely to be usable by other consumers, whether human or automated.More complex series of triples can be linked together. A type of pottery is discovered in a building.That pottery has an origin and the building has a terminus post quem.All of this can represented as triples.If URIs are used, then those triples can refer to definitions distributed across the Internet.

    "One of my main takeaways from the 2012 Linked Ancient World Data Institute was the need for a comprehensive bibliography of scholarly literature in the field of ancient studies that is both open and follows the principles of linked data (see also [Elliott 2012]).Such a resource could facilitate scholarly work across many related sub-disciplines and increase discoverability of academic studies that mention specific subjects.

ISAW Papers, the Institute for the Study of the Ancient Worlds digital scholarly journal, is both its topic and its venue.These overlapping roles will prove useful by allowing direct illustration of the progress ISAW has made in implementing the goals with which the journal was initiated. Source: ISAW Papers: Towards a Journal as Linked Open Data. Sebastian Heath. ISAW Papers 7.8 (2014)",
    "By way of high-level overview, those goals are to publish article-length scholarship that (1) is available at no-cost to readers, (2) that can be reused and redistributed under a Creative Commons license, and (3) that is stored in formats that are very likely to be readable into the far future.Additionally, articles in ISAW Papers should link to stable resources similarly available on the public Internet.

    "The discussion is practice oriented and so makes reference to the articles published to date.This approach and the movement from overview to specifics is intended to introduce readers to some of the opportunities ISAW Papers has recognized and also to the challenges it faces.#p2To start broadly, the editorial scope of ISAW Papers is as wide as ISAWs intellectual mission, which itself embraces the development of cultures and civilizations around the Mediterranean basin, and across central Asia to the Pacific Ocean. (ISAW n.d.) Temporally, ISAW is mainly concerned with complex cultures before the advent of early modern globalization. Source: ISAW Papers: Towards a Journal as Linked Open Data. Sebastian Heath.

    "Though it is important to note that ISAW does not try to impose strict limits on what falls within its intellectual purview.Indeed, the origins, development and reception of all phases of the Ancient World are fair game at ISAW.#p3Review and LicensingTwo additional concerns of a scholarly journal - review and licensing - can also be addressed efficiently. ISAW Papers publishes anonymously peer-reviewed articles as well as articles read and forwarded for publication by members of the ISAW faculty.

    "This aspect of the editorial process is made clear for each article.The goal here is to provide a balance between the many benefits that peer review can provide to an author while similarly ensuring that it is neither a barrier to new work nor an impediment to timely publication.In terms of licensing, ISAW asks authors to agree to distribution of their text under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) license. Source: ISAW Papers: Towards a Journal as Linked Open Data. Sebastian Heath. ISAW Papers 7.8 (2014)",
    "The same applies to images authors have created on their own or which ISAW creates during the editorial process.We consider such open distribution to be an important component of a robust approach to future accessibility.It is, however, the case that authors have needed to include images whose copyright is held by others.This situation remains a fact of public scholarly discourse.Accordingly, we ask that authors obtain permission for ISAW to publish such images in digital form but do not require explicit agreement to a CC license.

Source: Beyond Maps as Images at the Ancient World Mapping Center. Ryan Horne. ISAW Papers 7.9 (2014)",
    "The atlas features 102 maps, extensive metadata in a map-by-map directory, and served as the catalyst for the establishment of the Ancient World Mapping Center (AWMC) at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and for the subsequent development of the Pleiades Project.#p1The goals of the AWMC are in part to refine, expand, and curate the data created for the atlas, to continue research into ancient geography, and to present data in an accessible, instructive form. Source: Beyond Maps as Images at the Ancient World Mapping Center. Ryan Horne. ISAW Papers 7.9 (2014)",
    "This includes the production of maps for publications and larger projects such as a series of wall maps.It was during the production of the wall maps that limitations to the AWMC's previous approach of primarily viewing maps as flat images became readily apparent.The sheer scale of the project, coupled with the myriad changes suggested by reviewers, revealed the necessity of an easily reproducible, readily searchable, and scalable system to display and sort the over 200,000 individual objects residing in the center's database. Source: Beyond Maps as Images at the Ancient World Mapping Center. Ryan Horne. ISAW Papers 7.9 (2014)",
    "As an outgrowth of this realization, the AWMC began an initiative to create an end-user customizable web application to generate maps and replace the older static images provided by the center.The first result of these efforts, the Antiquity u00c0-la-carte application, was launched in March 2012 with a major update following in October of the same year.#p2In order to complete these projects, the AWMC began to catalog, analyze, and offer its data to the larger scholarly community under a Creative Commons CC BY-NC 3.0 license. AWMC's data is primarily geographic and contained within Shapefiles, with coastlines, water coverage, water courses, and other natural and human constructed features adjusted for their state in the ancient world.

    "All of the data was initially offered as Shapefile and GeoTiff downloads that presented easily accessible resources which nevertheless had severely limited potential for dynamic linking, searching, and other complex interactions.Further steps were needed to move beyond these largely static data sets.#p3As the AWMC is partnered with the Pleiades project, the association of geographic items with Pleiades IDs coupled with a database-driven interface was the obvious next phase in the evolution of the center's offerings. Source: Beyond Maps as Images at the Ancient World Mapping Center. Ryan Horne. ISAW Papers 7.9 (2014)",
    "Key to this step was the creation of an interface and the modification of the AWMC's data in order to adhere to URI best practices and 5-star principles as outlined by Tim Berners-Lee (1998 and 2007), including permanence, simplicity, and a naming scheme that is agnostic to the underlying content of data.The alignment of the center's resources with Pleiades IDs for all features, along with adding custom metadata where appropriate, became the foundation for the center's movement towards these goals. Source: Beyond Maps as Images at the Ancient World Mapping Center. Ryan Horne. ISAW Papers 7.9 (2014)",
    "The first step at the AWMC was the creation of a PostGIS database to house and display Pleiades data, which is followed by the use of GIS software to identify and add appropriate metadata to the Shapefiles produced by the center (a task which is largely done by hand), then the subsequent importation of completed Shapefiles into the PostGIS database.As this work was underway, a further step towards deeper integration with the linked data community occurred in January 2013, when the AWMC created an API interface to its database using RESTful URIs and joined the Pelagios Project.

    "ISAW Papers 7.10 (2014)Open Context and Linked DataEric KansaIntroductionArchaeologists have long grappled with the challenges inherent in data sharing.They have traditionally relied on monographs and site reports to communicate, in detail, the results of excavations and surveys.However, growing dependence on digital technologies has eroded the utility of these traditional dissemination strategies. Source: Open Context and Linked Data. Eric C. Kansa. ISAW Papers 7.10 (2014)",
    "Archaeologists now collect far more (digital) documentation than can be feasibly and cost-effectively shared in print.There is also more to digital data than sheer quantity.Archaeologists routinely organize data into structures (usually tables or relational databases) in order to use software to search, query, analyze, summarize, and visualize data.As interest in structured data grows, archaeologists need new venues to access and share structured data.#p1Data sharing usually means sharing structured data in formats that can be easily loaded into data management software (ranging from Excel, to a GIS, to something more specialized), queried, visualized and analyzed.

    "New rules imposed by granting agencies, especially data management plans, as well as changing professional expectations are all converging to make data dissemination a regular aspect of their scholarly communications.Archaeologists increasingly recognize the need to preserve the documented archaeological record by accessioning data into preservation repositories.At the same time, more researchers regard data sharing an aspect of good professional practice, so that data underlying interpretations and narratives of the past are available available for independent reinterpretation.#p2The following discussion outlines Open Contexts current approach to publishing archaeological data.

    "Many researchers focus on the need to preserve these data, especially because of the destructive nature of many archaeological field methods.Though data archiving is of critical importance, data management needs extend well beyond preservation for the sake of preservation.To be understood and useful in the future, and to be comparable to other datasets, datasets usually need rich documentation and alignment to standards and vocabularies used by other data sources.

    "While wider appreciation and fluency in these technologies will be most welcome, not every archaeologist needs to become an expert Web technologist.Just as we do not expect every archaeologist to personally develop all of the expertise needed to run a print publication venue, a neutron activation analysis lab, or other specialization, we should not expect every archaeologist to become a Web technology guru.

    "The phrase data sharing as publication helps to encapsulate and communicate the investment and skills needed to make data easier to reuse.It conveys the idea that data dissemination can be a collaborative undertaking, where data authors and specialized editors work together contributing different elements of expertise and taking on different responsibilities.

    "This approach toward Web identifiers represents a fundamental aspect of Open Contexts participation in a larger information ecosystem.Secondly, Open Context references Linked Data published by other expert communities.Like many of the projects discussed at the LAWDI meetings, Open Context references the Pleiades gazetteer (Elliot and Gillies 2009; http://pleiades.stoa.org/).This helps remove ambiguity about ancient places that may be referenced in data published by Open Context.

    "Referencing Pleiades also makes it easier to relate Open Context content with content from other sources that also reference Pleiades.However, because of the nature of the content Open Context publishes, relatively few records link to Pleiades.Most of the data in Open Context comes from excavations focusing on prehistoric periods, or on subdomains of archaeology where Pleiades has less relevance.Besides Pleiades, Open Context increasingly references the British Museums controlled vocabulary and the Wikipeida (for stable identifiers to relevent concepts), as demonstrated in this example of an object from Poggio Civitate (http://opencontext.org/subjects/AF3090B0-301C-41A0-D290-3F616AC074EF).

    "We are currently experimenting with mapping data published by Open Context with the CIDOC-CRM (see: http://opencontext.org/about/services#rdf) Open Context started in 2007 and we initially chose ArchaeoML (the Archaeological Markup Language) developed by David Schloen (2001) with the OCHRE project (formerly XSTAR).We chose ArchaeoML because it provided a simple and very general organizational schema that we could readily apply with very diverse forms of archaeological data. Source: Open Context and Linked Data. Eric C. Kansa. ISAW Papers 7.10 (2014)",
    "The fact that Open Context now successfully publishes more than 35 different projects of wide geographic, chronological and thematic scope illustrates the utility of ArchaeoML.For our purposes, ArchaeoML worked and continues to work.Also, in 2007 when we first launched Open Context, we found XML technologies to be relatively straightforward and easy deploy, whereas RDF based technologies seemed more experimental and challenging at the time. Source: Open Context and Linked Data. Eric C. Kansa. ISAW Papers 7.10 (2014)",
    "However, since 2007 the landscape has changed dramatically.ArchaeoML never saw widespread adoption.The OCHRE project itself has since deprecated ArchaeoML, so its usefulness as a data interchange format was never realized.At the same time, more and more cultural heritage information systems began adopting the CIDOC-CRM as a standard for organizing data.The CIDOC-CRM became enshrined as an ISO standard, and is all but required by many funding agencies, particularly in the European Union. CIDOC-CRM therefore seems like a natural choice for the publication of archaeological data according to widely accepted standards. Source: Open Context and Linked Data. Eric C. Kansa. ISAW Papers 7.10 (2014)",
    "Over the past two years, Open Context began experimenting with publishing RDF data organized according to the CIDOC-CRM.Our experience in doing so has made us somewhat ambivalent about the effort and returns involved in aligning data to a complex ontology like the CIDOC-CRM, at least at this stage.The CIDOC-CRM represents a tremendous intellectual achievement.It results from a great amount of effort and thought by leading experts in cultural heritage informatics. Source: Open Context and Linked Data. Eric C. Kansa. ISAW Papers 7.10 (2014)",
    "Recent archaeology extensions of the CIDOC-CRM, led by English Heritage (Tudhope et al. 2011), also represent important informatics contributions.However, to paraphrase a famous meme, one does not simply map to the CRM. The CIDOC-CRMs sophistication also makes it difficult to use in practice.For example, we recently had a discussion with a librarian trying to use the CIDOC-CRM to organize some archaeological data from a survey for publication in Open Context. Source: Open Context and Linked Data. Eric C. Kansa. ISAW Papers 7.10 (2014)",
    "The librarian used the CIDOC-CRM property P3 has_note as a predicate for use with Munsell color readings of potsherds.This raised some interesting issues.It is probably debatable if a Munsell color reading is simply a descriptive note or if a Munsell color reading is more of a measurement.If the latter, then the CIDOC-CRM property P43F has_dimension would probably be a more appropriate predicate. Source: Open Context and Linked Data. Eric C. Kansa. ISAW Papers 7.10 (2014)",
    "In theory, Munsell can be seen as an objective measurement.In practice, many researchers take Munsell readings because they vaguely think they should, and then they do not adequately control for all sorts of issues (lighting conditions, dampness, color blindness, etc.) that may impact a Munsell reading.The example above illustrate how difficult the CIDOC-CRM can be to use in practice.The CIDOC-CRM contains many conceptual nuances that can lead to different potential mappings. Source: Open Context and Linked Data. Eric C. Kansa. ISAW Papers 7.10 (2014)",
    "In addition, mapping to the CIDOC-CRM, or any other vocabulary or ontology for that matter, carries with it interpretive decisions.One has to make a judgement call if a Munsell reading measures a dimension or if it is simply a note.Finally, in many cases, one may not have sufficient information about a dataset to make these judgement calls.Sebastian Heath (https://github.com/lawdi/LAWD/issues/3#issuecomment-18934276) raised similar issues with respect to modeling archaeological contexts, especially from legacy excavations where the tacit knowledge behind excavation documentation may be lost. Source: Open Context and Linked Data. Eric C. Kansa. ISAW Papers 7.10 (2014)",
    "These issues would be easier to navigate if one could refer to established practice, and look at other examples of the CIDOC-CRM in use as a guide.However, despite the prominence of the CIDOC-CRM, it is surprisingly hard to find actual CIDOC-CRM organized datasets to use as examples, at least in archaeology.More real-world implementations of the CIDOC-CRM would provide invaluable guidance.Part of the value of referencing Pleiades comes from Pelagios (see Simon et al. 2012), a system that aggregates Pleiades annotations. Source: Open Context and Linked Data. Eric C. Kansa. ISAW Papers 7.10 (2014)",
    "The services provided by Pelagios make investing in Pleiades annotations worthwhile.Unfortunately, the CIDOC-CRM has no clear analog to Pelagios.We currently need to wait for mandarins of the CIDOC-CRM to review our mappings in order to get feedback, and even if this happens, our efforts would seem only relevant and noticed by a narrow audience of CIDOC-CRM aficionados.Systems that aggregate CIDOC-CRM content would be ideal, since such systems could help provide feedback about which mappings make sense and which do not. Source: Open Context and Linked Data. Eric C. Kansa. ISAW Papers 7.10 (2014)",
    "Without implementations that give such feedback, our experiments with mapping Open Context data to the CIDOC-CRM will go untested and mainly have theoretical value.In other words, right now, Open Contexts mappings to the CIDOC-CRM feel a little bit like eating spinach: in theory, it is good for us, but in practice, it is hard to identify its tangible benefits.Lessons on Linking Data in PracticeOur struggles with the CIDOC-CRM illustrate some of the tensions behind different visions of Linked Data and the Semantic Web. In my view, the CIDOC-CRM represents an approach that seems very much at home with the Semantic Web. I see the Semantic Web as much more of a totalizing vision that emphasizes ontology and schema alignment between datasets across the Web. Source: Open Context and Linked Data. Eric C. Kansa. ISAW Papers 7.10 (2014)",
    "By reference to common conceptual models, the Semantic Web could enable powerful inference capabilities that draw upon logical relationships between data and ontologies.The problem with this vision is that non-trivial ontologies like the CIDOC-CRM can be hard to use in practice.They can be also be used inconsistently (as illustrated with the example about Munsell values above).Beyond these practical problems, the research community has yet to really grapple with the theoretical implications of ontology standards. Source: Open Context and Linked Data. Eric C. Kansa. ISAW Papers 7.10 (2014)",
    "Is the CIDOC-CRM really universally appropriate for all cultural heritage data?Should there be room for alternative ontologies that reflect different research priorities and assumptions?In enshrining the CIDOC-CRM as an ISO standard, are we enshrining and privileging one particular (and contingent) perspective on the past without first adequately exploring other options?Again, to my knowledge, nobody has harvested CIDOC-CRM mapped data from Open Context. Source: Open Context and Linked Data. Eric C. Kansa. ISAW Papers 7.10 (2014)",
    "So I lack feedback about the quality of our implementation of the CIDOC-CRM and I lack examples of inferences made using the CIDOC-CRM and Open Context data.Thus, realizing the benefits of a Semantic Web vision of ontology aligned data seems remote in the areas of archaeology Open Context serves.Archaeological excavation data typically has relevance for very narrow research interests and communities.

    "Bryn Mawr Classical Review reaches a daily email and online readership of 13,000 people worldwide; it is well known in the humanities internationally and because it has always been open access, is widely read not only within academic communities but by the interested public.Following LAWDI 2012 and my introduction to linked data, for which I'm particularly grateful to the organizers, Tom Elliott, Sebastian Heath, and John Muccigrosso, I obtained grant support in 2013 from the Trico (i.e., Bryn Mawr, Haverford, and Swarthmore Colleges) Digital Humanities initiative to begin publishing linked data for BMCR.#p1BMCR is a publication of Bryn Mawr Commentaries, Inc., a non-profit organization that sells Bryn Mawr Greek and Latin Commentaries, inexpensive Greek and Latin textbooks that provide text and explanatory notes geared toward a college-level readership.

    "Ongoing expenses cannot grow, and neither reviewers (who are already asked to assist with basic formatting) nor editors can be asked to take on significant additional responsibilities in order to enhance BMCR.The challenge of adapting the web publication of BMCR is to do so within the limited budget and limited staff and editorial time available.#p2All reviews are stored as TEI-encoded files, with the result that structured metadata exists behind each file. BMCR reviews have (with one or two exceptions from the early years in the 1990s) clean URIs. Source: Bryn Mawr Classical Review. Camilla MacKay. ISAW Papers 7.13 (2014)",

A separate blog (on Blogger) was added in 2008 to allow comments on reviews; reviews are automatically published to the blog and linked to the main site.1#p3We investigated using RDFa to publish linkable data in BMCR reviews, and led by Karen Coyle, we plan to repurpose the existing TEI metadata as schema.org data..

    "Since BMCR has, for several years, used Endnote to pull citations from WorldCat, the WorldCat ID number exists in our Endnote files, and with some effort we may be able to generate WorldCat identities (as published in worldcat.org) fairly easily for a couple of thousand reviews, and going forward, can incorporate their inclusion in the schema.org data.#p4Another form of data perhaps useful for publishing as linked data consists of the author of the review, one of the tagged fields.

(Reviewers who review more than once for BMCR often provide different forms of their own names from review to review; we do not have our own authorities, so the same reviewer can be indexed differently even in BMCR.)#p5A particular problem is figuring out how BMCR's linked data might be useful in a real world environment.2 It is easy to imagine that publishing data to the effect that a particular BMCR URI is a review of a particular book, identified by the worldcat.org URI, could allow a library catalog, for example, to automatically pull in a BMCR review about a particular book, regardless of the format.

Source: Bryn Mawr Classical Review. Camilla MacKay. ISAW Papers 7.13 (2014)",
    "The process must be close to automatic and thus our pressure to make a few good choices.Will our publication of schema.org data enable this?It is unclear exactly what benefit we (or our readers, or searchers) will gain, but the cost is low.3#p7Another promising possibility for linking out from BMCR arises from recent discussions with Josh Sosin, Hugh Cayless, and Ryan Baumann of the new Duke Collaboratory for Classics Computing about linking papyrological and epigraphic texts cited in BMCR reviews, using Trismegistos numbers. Source: Bryn Mawr Classical Review. Camilla MacKay. ISAW Papers 7.13 (2014)",
    "Relatively few BMCR reviews cover books on these topics, and so even retrospective linking for these reviews back to 1990 would be manageable.Reviewers of books on these topics too (especially papyrology) might add coding for these links on their own should we start requesting links in the review.This project may help determine the feasibility and usefulness of adding more links from the content of BMCR reviewsSource: Bryn Mawr Classical Review.

    "Moreover, while the majority of the hoards recorded in CHRR are from the Roman Republic, a significant number of the later hoards (about 10% of all hoards in the database) do contain issues of the Imperial period.Since we have used nomisma.org identifiers within CHRR, it has been possible both to enrich the CHRR database with type descriptions from OCRE (see eg.Fig. 6a), but also to enrich OCRE with findspots derived from the CHRR database (see eg.

    "Rather than updating records in OCRE when the collections of new partners become available, the RDF database stands apart, and thus it is easier to update Fuseki with new collections and manage changes or deletions in collections already contained in the system.Using SPARQL, OCRE (through the Numishare application code) can query Fuseki to display images of coins associated with particular types in record or search results pages. SPARQL query results can be serialized into KML directly and displayed in maps, making it possible to make use of findspots from online coin hoard catalogs (Fig. 7).

    "This linking of datasets is subject to the same challenges as any equivalent exchange between humans: in order to share knowledge, systems need an effective method of communication.Our task as human experts in charge of data sets is to publish that data in machine-readable, non-proprietary formats, with clear URIs.The adoption of existing ontologies and controlled vocabularies enables the linking of new datasets to existing projects via shared elements such as locations (Pleiades gazetteer1, for example), people (perhaps though projects such as the Berkeley Prosopography Service2) or any other defined, identified element which occurs in more than one dataset.#p1The tools, the dataOntologies have played a major role in my on-going doctoral research project, which combines elements from the domain of Semantic Technologies but focuses on Ancient World Data.

    "This work in progress involves issues of Knowledge Representation, Description Logic, Coreference, and its tools are SPARQL, RDF, URIs and OWL.The aim of this research project is to assess the suitability of existing tools for the representation of the ambiguous, incomplete and at times unknown literary narratives that play out within the content of compositions written in the ancient language of Sumerian, and published by the Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature (henceforth ETCSL)3, an online resource from the University of Oxford, which allows the public free and unlimited access to the lemmatised transliteration and English translation of some 400 composite texts.#p2Two OWL ontologiesThis research project began with an extensive review, and led to the identification and subsequent evaluation of two OWL ontologies thought to be suitable for the representation of cultural heritage data and narrative structures: the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC CRM)4 and Ontomedia (OM)5. Source: Assessing the suitability of existing OWL ontologies for the representation of narrative structures in Sumerian literature.Terhi Nurmikko-Fuller. ISAW Papers 7.18 (2014)",
    "The decision to include the CIDOC CRM was two-fold.Firstly, this event-based reference model is specifically designed as the semantic glue6 for linking cross-domain cultural heritage data, and has been implemented by institutions with large cuneiform collections, such as the British Museum.7 Although the ETCSL carries little object data directly, the print, electronic and cuneiform sources for each composite text are listed with each transliteration and serve as potential anchoring points for clusters of RDF triples that would allow the enrichment of the ETCSL data from other sources within Assyriology and the wider Digital Heritage community.

    "Secondly, OM, the second ontology and one designed for the representation of narrative, was purposely designed to link to the CIDOC CRM (Lawrence 2008).Unlike the CIDOC CRM which is one large, all-encompassing structure, OM consists of several interlinking sub-ontologies, amongst which the user-consumer can opt to pick and choose any that bear relevance to their data. OM is essentially an domain-specific upper-level ontology : this oxymoron can be justified if one agrees that the ontological representation of narratives is itself a niche topic but that since OM seeks to be applicable to all fictional narratives (regardless of sub-genre), it can be seen as an example of the class of upper-level ontologies.#p3mORSuLThe combination of the CIDOC CRM and OM and the addition of a number of specific elements deemed necessary resulted in the creation of mORSuL (the multi-Ontology Representing Sumerian Literature).

    "Thus far, it has been implemented in the Stanford University ontological editor, Protu00e9gu00e98 and serves as part of a proof-of-concept.Preliminary trials with mORSuL have led to two initial conclusions: the ontology is to be extended further to allow for the mapping of bibliographical data as published by the ETCSL (BIBO9 and FRBRoo10 are likely candidates) and the representation of literary tools such as similes, metaphors and analogies.

    "Secondly, the resulting large and complex structure ought to be reduced to contain only those classes and properties which truly match the data available from the ETCSL.#p4Sumerian humour as an example case studyThe next step was to test mORSuL with a case-study example.The chosen composition Three Ox-drivers of Adab is thought to be a humorous one (Alster, 1991-1993; Foster, 1974) and has a narrative structure with repetitive patterns within a frame story u2013 due to the incomplete nature of the latter part of the piece (a result of the fracture and loss of the lower parts of the witness tablets on which the composite text is based) the representation was limited to the first 35 lines only.

    "Although these issues are discussed in greater detail in my thesis (forthcoming), a few examples can be cited to exemplify the types of decisions which need to be made when representing the narrative and the fabula (as defined by Bal, 2009).Firstly, although the events depicted are fictional, the story is set in, or at least refers to, the historical city of Adab (modern Bismaya).The natural laws that govern our reality are applicable to the main ome:Context too (the reality in which the story takes place) and at no point is the reader required to suspend their disbelief or encounter entities or events that are magical, supernatural or within a dream.

    "The representation of the ox-drivers decision to seek justice is however more complex as is the decision whether to treat it as an instance pertaining to a ome:Social subclass of Legal.It is also worth noting that from the perspective of each ox-driver, they are (presumably) each seeking a decision favourable to themselves and not one which is truly fair.Furthermore, the only account of the events that form the main part of the narrative are the focalised memories of the ox-drivers, and the subsequent retelling of these events by the king, who did not witness them first hand.

    "It may also be argued that the focalised story told to the king is to be seen as an amalgamation of three separate accounts of the events that took place outside the narrative, and the story told to the king is effectively a composite memory.#p8Further workResearch into the representation of Sumerian literary narratives using OWL ontologies continues.The next, imminent stages of the project include the extension and reduction of mORSuL, as well as the addition of data from other Sumerian literary compositions, so that the structure can be queried in terms of intertextuality, reoccurring motifs and possible instances of literary allusions.

    "Name-matching rules are generally modeled as shift rules.Rules that provide additional evidence for a match are modeled as a boost, and tend to leverage features like location or activity.Rules that provide evidence of counter-indication are modeled as a discount; examples include date rules that consider the typical life-span and span of activity, along with the dates of respective activities (if two activities are 30 years apart, there is less likelihood that two person/name instances refer to the same real-world person, and so even if a name matches, a discount reduces the effect of the collapse).#p12Rules may apply only to person/names within a document (intra-document rules), or to persons across the corpus (inter-document rules).

    "Many rules can operate in either model, but function slightly differently in the two contexts.The end result of applying the rules is a set of probabilities for each name-instance, for the set of real-word persons to which that name instance may correspond (low weight probabilities can be filtered out to simply results).Each researcher can configure their confidence in each rule that is configured for their corpus, and thereby individually control how the heuristic proceeds.

    "Changing these values can also allow researchers to explore what-if scenarios.#p13Once the disambiguation model has run and produced weighted probabilities for each name-instance in a document, a researcher can review these in the UI, and then decide to confirm or discard the results of the model.These assertions are modeled as an action that the model can take to override the computed results, and so operate something like a boost or discount (in fact, the user can optionally set a confidence on each assertion, so it may be more of a hint than a conclusion on their part).#p14Within the BPS model broadly, assertions have (one or more) anchors in corpus document(s) that specify the resources (in the most general sense) upon which the assertion operates, an action that must be realizable in the model, and provenance (the researcher ID and date when it was created).

Source: It's about time: historical periodization and Linked Ancient World Data. Adam Rabinowitz. ISAW Papers 7.22 (2014) ",
    "When asked to mark ancient places on a map, students excel.When asked to place objects within a historical, archaeological, or art-historical period and to assign a corresponding date range, however, the same students sometimes seem to be picking terms and dates at random.We can see ancient places inscribed in present spaces, and we can imagine ourselves in them.But ancient time undergoes a curious flattening process, in which developments that took place over centuries appear to have happened all at once in a great jumble. Source: It's about time: historical periodization and Linked Ancient World Data. Adam Rabinowitz. ISAW Papers 7.22 (2014) ",
    "Introduce into this confusion the idea that periods are essentially arbitrary conventions about which scholars disagree, and many students will decide that the periodization of the ancient world is simply impossible to learn.#p1Similar problems apply to the role of temporal divisions in the Linked Ancient World Data environment.Conceptual entities that we can associate with concrete physical manifestations -- people, places, texts -- have provided the foundations for a growing Linked Ancient World Data infrastructure in which it is increasingly easy to discover semantically-related information.

    "Authoritative spatial gazetteers like the Pleiades platform have not only made it possible to extract maps from texts by matching place names to geographic coordinates, they have also provided a conceptual connection that initiatives such as the Pelagios Project (Simon, Barker and Isaksen 2012) have been able to use to bring together material associated with the same site in different databases (for example, material associated with ancient Athens). Source: It's about time: historical periodization and Linked Ancient World Data. Adam Rabinowitz. ISAW Papers 7.22 (2014) ",
    "The use of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) for people, places, and things sidesteps the barriers to discovery created by the use of different metadata schemata, different vocabularies, or different languages.At the same time, however, it requires general agreement about the identity of the underlying entity: Athens, Athenae, Athen, Afen, Athina have to refer to the same socio-political unit located at more or less the same geographic coordinates. #p2Periods have been modeled as abstract components of formal ontologies (e.g. the CIDOC-CRM: http://www.cidoc-crm.org/crm-concepts/#_Toc224984167; Doerr, Kritsotaki and Stead 2005; Doerr, Kritsotaki and Stead 2010), and directory or gazetteer-based approaches have been attempted on several occasions -- for example, in the Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative (Petras et al. 2006) and the Common Eras project (Isaksen et al. 2009).

    "But periods have proven to work poorly with Linked Data principles, which require well-defined entities for linking.As concepts of convenience, often invented by a single scholar in a seminal work but then modified and debated over long periods of time, deliberately left vague in temporal terms in order to protect their usefulness for relative chronologies, individual periods have no objective existence. Source: It's about time: historical periodization and Linked Ancient World Data. Adam Rabinowitz. ISAW Papers 7.22 (2014) ",
    "Yet they are deeply entangled with both physical space and absolute time, the latter measured by concrete calendar systems and ultimately by the physical rotation of the earth and its movement around the sun.Particular period terms are associated with particular absolute dates in particular places; in turn, changes in the identity of a place at a particular geographic location can only be described in terms of the passage of time, often in the form of historical periodization.#p3The creation of an agreed-upon controlled vocabulary for periods therefore requires either highly local definitions or definitions that are so broad and vague as to be all-encompassing.

    "Both types exist: local vocabularies in use in the UK heritage community, for example, define the Iron Age as a period (presumably only in Britain) lasting from 800 BC to AD 43, the year of the Roman conquest (e.g. http://www.fish-forum.info/i_apl_e.htm), while the Getty Thesaurus of Art & Architecture, which seeks to offer more universal concepts, describes a global Iron Age in terms of the three-age system and notes generally that it has different dates in different places. Source: It's about time: historical periodization and Linked Ancient World Data. Adam Rabinowitz. ISAW Papers 7.22 (2014) ",
    "It also offers a facet for the European Iron Age, which has several stylistic-chronological subgroups: here, the only value associated with Britain is the La Tu00e8ne period/culture, which is placed in space in Northern Europe and the British isles and in time from the mid-fifth century BCE to the mid-first century BCE.Though this definition and that of the UK heritage community overlap partially in time, space and concept, they employ different terms; conversely, a single period term such as Iron Age can change dramatically in meaning according to where it is used, or by whom. Source: It's about time: historical periodization and Linked Ancient World Data. Adam Rabinowitz. ISAW Papers 7.22 (2014) ",
    "For Linked Data purposes, then, this is not a simple question of using URIs from a shared gazetteer to align different terms for the same period concept. A solution is needed that recognizes the fact that different scholars can conceptualize the same time range or cultural phenomenon quite differently, while others use the same terms to describe time ranges or cultural phenomena that differ to varying degrees.#p4I first encountered this problem during the development of GeoDia, an interactive spatial timeline of ancient Mediterranean history and archaeology (Rabinowitz 2013).

    "The original design was focused on archaeological and art-historical periodization, as a way to explain visually to students how ancient remains were grouped together (Figure 1).#p5We began with the idea that we would have general, Getty-AAT-style periods that would then be attached to individual archaeological sites.But major problems with this approach soon began to emerge.Using a generic periodization meant, in some cases, that sites would be represented with periods that were not used to describe them in the literature. Source: It's about time: historical periodization and Linked Ancient World Data. Adam Rabinowitz. ISAW Papers 7.22 (2014) ",
    "In other cases, it meant a conflict between the date-range of a period to be represented in the timeline and the history of a particular site.Pompeii is a good example: though Pompeii exists during the more general Flavian period, that site ends abruptly in AD 79, in the middle of that period, with the eruption of Vesuvius.The idiosyncrasies of particular regions and sites therefore led us to a data-model in which the basic unit was the site period, in most cases a local manifestation, with a site-specific date range, of a more general period concept (Figure 2).#p6Because GeoDia, as a synchronized mashup of a map and a timeline, relies on places with geographic coordinates, it was relatively easy to join the Linked Ancient World Data ecosystem, at least peripherally, by attaching Pleiades URIs to its sites.

    "But it quickly became apparent that allowing links back in was impossible, because the interface does not display places: it displays a dynamic combination of location and site periods drawn from separate tables in the underlying database.We could consume URIs, but we couldn't produce them.Furthermore, while Pleiades URIs could be pulled in on a semi-automatic basis, it was impossible to connect GeoDia periods or site periods with controlled vocabularies.

    "It was therefore impossible to take advantage of the possibilities for automated data integration offered by Linked Data approaches -- for example, the association of Flickr photos with ancient places in Pleiades through the use of URI-based machine tags.Frustration with this situation led me to join what I soon realized was a growing chorus of voices calling for the better integration of time in spatial approaches to history (Gregory 2007, Berman 2011, Janowicz 2012, Elliott 2013, Grossner 2013). #p7The addition of when to a Linked Ancient World Data landscape that currently focuses on where and who will not come, however, through the development of a consensus-based gazetteer for globally-recognized period concepts.

    "Even if such a vocabulary could be developed, and even if a majority of data managers were to adopt it for future work (a big if), it could not be retrofitted to deal with the diversity of period definitions already present in existing print and digital resources without a significant loss of information.Furthermore, I do not think it is desirable to smooth out scholarly disagreements and differences regarding the definition of periods, for this discussion is a fundamental part of the rich history of scholarship on the ancient world. #p8A solution to this problem must therefore take into account the diverse ways in which we use and understand periodization in our scholarship, and it must have the flexibility to accommodate conflicting or changing definitions for periods.

    "In the first case, one might wish to find all records associated with the range 400-300 BC from a series of datasets that use various period terms for the same span (Hellenistic, Classical, Late Classical, Early Republican, Iron Age, etc.).In the second, one might wish to see only records associated with Classical Athens, or only references to the name used for a site in a given period (e.g.Cherson, the name used for Crimean Chersonesos in the Middle Byzantine period), or only records associated with period terms used to describe remains in a particular geographic region.

    "To support the disambiguation of canonical citations such a knowledge base needs to contain, for example, all possible abbreviations of the name of an author or the title of a work, possibly in multiple languages if working on multi-lingual corpora.Since the texts we are dealing with are canonical it is possible to use this knowledge base to store, in addition to abbreviations, detailed information about the citable structures of each text such as, for example, how many books are contained in Thucydides Histories, how many chapters are contained in book 1 etc. Source: Mining Citations, Linking Texts.ISAW Papers 7.24 (2014)",

    "They were designed, well before the advent of digital technologies, to refer to texts in a very precise and interoperable way: precise because texts are the fundamental object of philological research, therefore a scholarly discourse about texts needs an accurate way of referring to them; interoperable because although texts may exist in different editions and translations, scholars need to be able to refer to specific sections of them without having to worry about the many possible variations in pagination or layout each single edition may present.#p10If we accept that canonical citations are already a way of linking objectsu2013i.e., the citing text and the cited textu2013extracting citations reconstructs and makes explicit links that already exist in the text.

    "IntroductionThe texts on the Papyrus Vindobonensis G 40822,1 now widely known as the Muziris papyrus, will be remembered as among the most significant pieces of evidence related to Indo-Roman trade published in the twentieth century, and the more we understand them, the more important they become.The extant portion of the text on the verso contains the monetary evaluation of three-quarters of the South Indian cargo loaded on the ship Hermapollon (probably at Muziris, mentioned in the text on the recto), and two recent papers, one by Federico Morelli and the other by me, have proposed an almost complete reconstruction of the evaluated commodities.

    "Both papers emphasized, albeit in very different measures, the predominant share of pepper and malabathron in the cargo, the two main exports from the Limyrike emporia.2 Both Morelli and I came to recognize that the 771 money talents and 4,632 drachmae recorded at col. i, ll. 25-263 are the value of (almost) three-quarters of the pepper cargo, but while Morelli suggests that that value resulted from a price of 24 drachmae per mina, I contend that a price of 6 drachmae per mina is the only price that can account for the position of other numerical values in the text.

    "Moreover, both Morelli and I interpret the weight number at col. i, l. 18 as the weight of three-quarters of the malabathron cargo, but while he reads the first two digits as 1,200 and assumes a price of 20 drachmae per mina, I read them as 1,800 and deduce a price of 12 drachmae per mina.Finally, I assume that the Hermapollons cargo included another commodity, evaluated at col. i, ll. 14-16, which might have been tortoise shell.

    "In this paper I would like to focus on two other commodities exported on the Hermapollon: the sound ivory tusks and the schidai.As the meaning of the Greek term schidai in the papyrus is disputed, it makes better sense to analyze the two commodities in reverse order of their appearance in the document.Therefore, we shall start with the schidai and later consider the sound ivory.#p1Schidai, ivory of lower value.

    "As we shall see, schidai represent less than 1% of the entire value of the Hermapollons cargo, and their weight was little more than half a ton.Yet a correct understanding of this entry will have a significant impact on the general interpretation of the text, and may shed some light both on the Cu0113ra kingdom to which the ancient Muziris belonged and on the ivory trade on the ancient Indian Ocean.#p2In the papyrological documents, the Greek term u03c3u03c7u03afu03b4u03b1u03b9 (schidai) occurs only on the verso of the Muziris papyrus col. ii, ll. 16 and 25.

    "Considering u03c3u03c7u03afu03b4u03b1 as only a variant of u03c3u03c7u03afu03b6u03b1 (piece of wood cut off, lath, splinter), Rathbone suggested that the schidai were fragments of elephant tusks and thus distinct from the sound ivory (u1f10u03bbu03adu03c6u03b1u03c2 u1f51u03b3u03b9u03aeu03c2) mentioned at col. ii, l. 4 of the same text, which were entire tusks.16 Rathbone buttressed his interpretation observing 1) that the u03bcu1f73u03bd at col. ii, l. 4 and a u03b4u1f73 to be read at col. ii, l. 1617 structured the phrase so as to contrast the sound ivory and the schidai;18 and 2) that the value of the unspecified ivory (u1f10u03bbu03adu03c6u03b1u03c2), lost with the lacuna at col. ii, l. 26, must have merged the value of the sound ivory with that of the schidai.

    "To me, Rathbones argument seems decisive on this point: if schidai were not ivory, the u03bcu1f73u03bd at col. ii, l. 4, would be a strange u03bcu1f73u03bd solitarium; and if schidai were not ivory, then we could not explainu2014except as a clerical erroru2014why the clerk records again the value of an unspecified ivory, after having already calculated the value of the schidai.Reasonable as it seemed at the time, the interpretation of the first editors does not accord as well with the context as does Rathbones reading.#p7Fragments or imperfect tusks?source: Federico De Romanis (2014).

    "That said, the sense of the contrast between sound ivory and schidai still remains to be properly understood.The difference of price between sound ivory (100 drachmae per mina) and schidai (70 drachmae per mina) makes it clear that schidai were ivory of secondary quality.However, was their quality secondary because they were accidental fragments rather than sawn pieces of ivory, as Rathbone assumed?source: Federico De Romanis (2014). Ivory from Muziris. ISAW Papers, 8.",
    "The question is far from trifling, not least because it is pivotal for determining the nature of the arabarchs share.#p8According to Rathbone, the evaluation preserved in the papyrus concerns only three-quarters of the Hermapollons cargo because one-quarter of the commodities would have been removed to pay the quarter-tax in kind.Consistently, the rationale of the share taken in addition by the arabarchs for the quarter-tax is seen as a way to simplify the practical division of sound ivory and schidai, two commodities from which an exact weight was not easy to extract.19 In other words, since it was impossible for the arabarchs to take exactly 25% of the ivory weights without sawing the tusks or the fragments (and thereby damaging the commodity), they took a little more than 25%: 11.75 minae (around 6 kgs), in the case of sound ivory; as much as 22.75 minae (around 11.6 kgs), in the case of the schidai.#p9The contradiction inherent in Rathbones argument was understood by Morelli, who follows Rathbone in assuming that the quarter-tax was paid in kind and that the function of the shares taken in addition by the arabarchs was to ease the payment in kind of the quarter-tax of commodities such as ivory tusks and schidai.20 Precisely for that reason, however, Morelli is reluctant to accept Rathbones conclusion that schidai were accidental fragments of tusks. Source: Federico De Romanis (2014). Ivory from Muziris. ISAW Papers, 8.",
    "His implicit reasoning is clear: if the 22.75 minae (= 11.6 kgs) taken in addition by the arabarchs are only a fraction of the weight of the smallest schida of the lot, the Greek term cannot refer to tusk fragments, but must refer rather to entire tusks that were imperfect in some wayu2014spoiled or cracked or only slightly broken.In other words, the schidai were in fact whole tusks, but not sound.21#p10There is very little doubt that the entry of sound ivory (u1f10u03bbu03adu03c6u03b1u03c2 u1f51u03b3u03b9u03aeu03c2) refers to entire tusks: at col. ii, ll. 12 and 13 the same commodity is mentioned as u1f40u03b4u03ccu03bdu03c4u03b5u03c2, teeth, and at col. i, l. 5 the figure 167 must be precisely the number of the tusks, as Morelli recognized.22 It is equally unquestionable that the adjective sound (u1f51u03b3u03b9u03aeu03c2) implies an assessment of the quality of the tusks, determining which tusk is sound and which is not.23 Nonetheless, the assumption that just two terms, sound ivory and schidai, could cover the entire spectrum of possible ivory classifications is unwarranted, and the fact that in this document sound ivory and schidai are opposed to each other does not guarantee that any tusk deemed not sound is by default a schida, or that a schida, as such, cannot be sound.

    "Nor should we assume that those fragments were necessarily unsound or accidental.Indeed, many of them were made on purpose and taken from perfectly sound tusks.#p11The schidai of the Muziris papyrus can hardly be identified with what elsewhere is called u03c0u03b5u03c1u03b9u03c0u03c1u03afu03c3u03bcu03b1u03c4u03b1 or u03c0u03b1u03c1u03b1u03c0u03c1u03afu03c3u03bcu03b1u03c4u03b1,25 namely, waste from the ivory carvers shops: the difference between the price of the tusks (100 drachmae per mina) and that of the schidai (70 drachmae per mina) is too small to address the gap in value between entire tusks and small scraps.26#p12In order to justify his translation of the term schidai, Rathbone recalled a passage by Pliny the Elder, in which the elephants are said to deliberately break their tusks in order to escape from hunters: u2018They themselves [sc.

    "As a matter of fact, another more prosaic explanation is at hand. I propose, in fact, to identify the schidai as those fragments that are regularly trimmed from the tusks of captive elephants.#p14Tusk trimming is a standard practice in Kerala today,31 but it was also common in ancient India, as is shown in some Sanskrit classical texts.Regular trimming of elephant tusks is mentioned in the Arthau015bu0101stra, in the lines that end the section dedicated to the duties of the hastyadhyaku1e63a, the superintendent of the elephants:#p15danta-mu016bla-paru012bu1e47u0101ha-dvi-guu1e47au1e43 projjhya kalpayet /abde dvy-ardhe nadu012b-ju0101nu0101u1e43 pau00f1ca-abde parvata-okasu0101m//Leaving the double length of the circumference of the tusk at the root, he should cut [sc. the rest], every two years and a half in the case of those [sc.

    "the Indian elephants are not provided with large tusks, but should they have such, they saw them off, that their weight may not encumber them in war.34The practice of leaving u2018the double length of the circumference of the tooth at its roots addresses the need to avoid cutting into the living pulp of the tusk.35 The fact that elephants living in the mountains may get their tusks trimmed less often than those living by the riverbanks has been taken as a proof of a slower growth rate of tusks of the mountain elephants.36Schidai and the arabarchs share If the above interpretation of the term u03c3u03c7u03afu03b4u03b1 is correct, then there are consequences to be drawn related to the fiscal procedures implied in the Muziris papyrus.

    "If the schidai mentioned in the text do refer to the remnants of ivory regularly trimmed away from tusks either every two and a half or every five years, then it follows that a schida normally weighed much less than an entire tusk, since the trimming has to leave u2018the double length of the circumference of the tooth at its roots. Therefore, the 22.75 minae (around 11.6 kgs) of schidai taken in addition by the arabarchs, far from being only a fraction of a schida, will equal several schidai. Source: Federico De Romanis (2014).

    "In conclusion, whatever was taken in addition was not randomly seized because it was impossible to do otherwise, but must have been rationally determined and deliberately taken.  As a matter of fact, it seems that the shares of sound ivory and schidai taken by the arabarchs were arithmetically defined.The quota of sound ivory (11.75 minae) results from charging 1 mina for every 10 weight talents (1/600, u1f11u03beu03b1u03bau03bfu03c3u03b9u03bfu03c3u03c4u03ae) of the total amount (105 weight talents and 13 minae, rounded up to 110 weight talents), plus the fraction of mina of the three-quarters (.75).

    "Since the values assumed by the Muziris papyrus and the maximum prices fixed by the Price Edict are meant to remain unaffected by the short-term supply-and-demand dynamics in any particular place in the Roman empire, the overturning of the hierarchy between the values of these two commodities was not due to episodic reasons.Indeed, such a radical change is likely to have been the result of complex factors that cannot be fully explored here.

    "Nonetheless, it may be worth pointing out that the low valuation of pepper in the Muziris papyrus is also dependent on the direct voyages to South India of ships like the Hermapollon.The cessation of that relatively economical pattern of trade must have contributed to the higher prices of pepper in late antiquity.40  The contrasting dynamics of ivory values may in part be illuminated by Plinys claim that in his time India, where only some of the male elephants have tusks,41 was the major supplier of ivory.42 If Pliny is to be trusted, then neither the excellent Adulis ivory nor the abundant, if inferior, Rhapta ivory,43 nor any other East African ivory,44 were major Mediterranean imports in the mid-first century CE.

    "The potential of the African continent, where both male and female elephants have tusks, was thus only marginally exploited.By late antiquity, however, the volume of African ivory exported had likely substantially increased,45 as suggested by the emphasis in the Expositio totius mundi et gentium on the countless number of elephants of India minor (=East Africa)46 and, less ambiguously, Cosmas Indicopleustes remarks about the population of Aithiopias elephants and the scope of the export of their ivory.47  One final observation may be made on this subject: Cosmas Indicopleustes also noted that the African elephants had bigger tusks than the Indian elephants.48 He was probably referring to African savanna elephants (Loxodonta Africana Africana), which tend to develop longer and thicker tusks than either the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) or the even smaller African forest elephant (Loxodonta Africana cyclotis).49 It has to be emphasized, though, that Cosmas information cannot be taken as an indication that, in the first centuries of the Christian era, the traded African ivory comprised tusks that were on average bigger than those of the traded Asian ivory.

    "It is therefore clear that the distinction made between big and small tusks in some of these documents cannot correspond with the contrast between tusks and schidai, which characterizes the Hermapollon cargo, if the schidai are, as I suggest, captive elephant tusk trimmings.In his Informau00e7u00e3o para el-rei written from Goa in 1530, Jordu00e3o de Freitas distinguishes between three types of ivory: 1) the good, big, sound, and clean one (bom grande su00e3o e linpo), whose value in Sofala was between thirty and forty maticais per bahar; 2) the small one (pequeno), whose tusks weigh between one and one-half farau00e7ola (= between 11.75 and 5.87 kgs) each, and whose value was half the price of the first type; 3) the even smaller one (mays meyudo), whose value in Sofala was ten to twelve maticais.86 The small size of the second and third types in de Freitas categorization and the low average weight of the listed African ivory lots can hardly be explained by just assuming that all of those tusks belonged to forest elephants (Loxodonta Africana cyclotis).

    "Such an assumption would be inconsistent with the present geographical distribution of that species, and it would still require one to emphasize the inattention to tusk size during the elephant hunts, since tusks lighter than 5.87 kgs must have belonged to very young animals, no matter the species.Apparently, African hunters were only marginally motivated by ivory traders or influenced by the different commercial values assigned to tusks of different size.

A further indication that Kenchreai is within one of the multiple active regions of LRA2 production and use comes from the Eastern Korinthia Archaeological Survey (EKAS), whose members recognized that combed body sherds were among the most abundant Late Roman artifact categories.23 When one considers LRA2 broadly, the recent publication of kilns at Dilesi in Boeotia adds to the increasing firm evidence that production was widespread.24  #p14 n nThere is diversity among the LRA2 vessels from the Threpsiades complex.

    "At Kenchreai the form presumably had a role in surplus-oriented economic activities.At this early stage of study, however, we stress that the exact use of these small containers is unclear, and indeed they may have had multiple uses. Another noteworthy feature of the assemblage is the presence of 222 “small handled stoppers” (Fig. 7). While the total counts of stoppers and vessels are not equivalent, there is no doubt that the stoppers were used to seal both the large and small LRA2 amphoras with which they were found. We note that the smaller stoppers fit well in the small LRA2s (Fig. 8), while the larger ones likewise fit well in the mouths of large LRA2s.32 Furthermore, many of the stoppers are too small for the typical LRA2s and would only work in an LRA2 Small. This is an indication that the contents of LRA2 Smalls were sealed by stoppers in preparation for some combination of transport and storage. Also present is a  much smaller number of stoppers formed by the widely attested technique of cutting down LRA2 body sherds.

    " The small handled stoppers bear more comment. The association between these objects and LRA2 vessels is well established and paired examples are occasionally published.33 Often a phrase such as hastily made is applied to them and there is every reason to think that such objects were made efficiently.34 It is, nonetheless, appropriate to recognize some skill in matching stopper to vessel, however that was accomplished. To put that another way, these Late Roman stoppers, each of which served the essential role of keeping an LRA2 amphora’s contents inside it during transport, were made with sufficient care to meet their purpose.

    "Workers handling liquid goods in the Early Byzantine Threpsiades complex also used at least two forms of funnels. One large form displays a proportion of spout to body (Fig. 9) that generally matches the overall profiles of late funnels published from Lechaion and farther afield from Athens, Crete, and Sicily.36 The second form has a much longer tube, one of which is illustrated in Figure 10, topped by a shallower bowl with an overhanging rim everted just below its upper lip.37 The narrow diameter of the long-tube form may have allowed air to pass out of an amphora while a worker filled it. We have also observed that the spout of the large funnels do fit well into the mouths of large LRA2s so that form might likewise work in the filling of amphoras. A general but still useful comparandum is a 29-cm-long bronze funnel said to be from Methylion in Thessaly and now in the British Museum (Fig. 11). This implement, which is tentatively dated to the sixth century, is notable for an inscription identifying it as property of the city.38 Among the finds from the Threpsiades complex is also a pierced screen from a strainer, a form that again would be useful in moving liquids between containers.

    "Activities Within the Building The presence of two sizes of LRA2 alongside a substantial number of stoppers and funnels in the Threpsiades complex points to the export of amphora-born goods via Kenchreai’s active port. In this regard, it is worth stressing that LRA2s reached many regions of the Mediterranean as well as to the British isles.39 But beyond this general statement many questions remain and many narratives are possible. Did local products come to the Threpsiades complex in LRA2 Smalls before being poured into larger vessels for seaborne transport? As we have already speculated, filling might have involved the long-spouted funnels, though the shorter form was also available as needed. Any specific reconstruction of activity in the building will likely remain conjectural, though further study of stratigraphic relationships may increase the confidence with which we address these issues.Source: Preliminary Report on Early Byzantine Pottery from a Building Complex at Kenchreai.

    "The published group of finds most directly comparable to the Threpsiades material in terms of both composition and geographic proximity comes from Isthmia.40 A group of LRA2 and related objects was deposited in the Roman bath during the fifth century, when the building had fallen into disuse. The deposit contained ten amphoras, at least two funnels, and an unspecified number of stoppers that are either cut down from LRA2 sherds or are of the “small handled” variety that are common at the Threpsiades complex. Considering the basic similarity between the Isthmia Bath material and the Kenchreai assemblage, it is interesting to note that both belong to the late or secondary phases of activity in the two structures. At Isthmia, the amphoras were placed among the hypocaust pilings in one former hotroom, where they have been tentatively interpreted as liquid-containers used by workmen living or working nearby. While this is a reasonable suggestion, it is important in the context of our study to note that the placement of these amphoras does not indicate a role in the export of regional agricultural products.Source: Preliminary Report on Early Byzantine Pottery from a Building Complex at Kenchreai. Heath, Rife et al., ISAW Papers 10 (2015)",
    "This apparent localized use of the vessels in the dilapidated Isthmia Bath distinguishes them from the much larger group of vessels in the seaside Threpsiades complex.The Threpsiades group of LRA2 amphoras that encompass two sizes, along with stoppers and funnels, should be understood in its regional economic context. To the extent that surplus agricultural production was ongoing in ca. 600, such activity supported and relied on a ceramic industry that in turn produced variants possibly intended only for local or regional use. That industry also produced specialized forms such as the funnels that allowed liquids to be poured into or out of amphoras. We can assert with confidence that such handling of liquid goods took place at Kenchreai. The remains from the Threpsiades complex thus attest to interrelated and perhaps self-sustaining complexity on the local and regional scales during the Early Byzantine period at Kenchreai.

    "Other Amphoras Complexity is also reflected in the imported amphoras from this assemblage (Table 1).41 LRA1, a type produced in both Cyprus and Cilicia, is well-represented. LRA4 and LRA5 from ancient Palestine occur regularly in the complex. Moreover, a few sherds of the reduced-fired variant of the Palestinian baggy amphora from Beit She’an (LRA6), some preserving traces of white-swirl decoration, were found. LRA3 is rare.42 Preliminary study also identified the uppermost part of a North African Keay 62 type hooked rim, a spatheion in unslipped and pale non-Tunisian fabric, a flat-bottomed amphora base in coarse brown fabric near to Reynolds’ “Beirut 8”, rims of a well-fired form previously known from Kenchreai and also present at Corinth,43 and short spike toes of “Samos Cistern” amphoras. Many less frequently transported amphoras from the Eastern Mediterranean are becoming more widely recognized by Roman ceramicists, and close inspection of the Threpsiades group may well augment the variety of forms known from Kenchreai.

    "Full washing of the diagnostics and body sherds will surely reveal further diversity.45 A few stubs from handles and a single rim of Neiderbeiber 77/Middle Roman Amphora 7 were present.

    "The LRA4s and LRA5s show that Palestinian vessels comprise the greatest share of the imported amphoras stored in the building. LRA1s, broadly speaking from Cyprus and Cilicia, are second, though they form a greater portion than either LRA4 or LRA5 individually. It is significant that the LRA4s and LRA5s both display a diversity of fabrics, though especially the LRA5s. Most examples of the type are in the typical reddish, coarse fabric with the ridged surface giving way to combing at the shoulder and varying in color from red to pale. At least two well-preserved vessels are in a slightly less coarse, reddish fabric with a distinct coating of pale wash. One LRA5 stands out due to its very pale light brown fabric. Among the examples of LRA4, most are in the distinctive dark brown fabric that makes the type very recognizable, but some are in fabric very similar to the standard LRA5 fabric. Both this diversity of fabrics and the coincidence between fabric and form are consistent with a growing awareness of the geographic overlap of the regions that produced these two forms.47 While the designations “LRA4” and “LRA5” remain useful rubrics for our preliminary processing that facilitate a concise and accessible summary of the data, these artificial modern terms should not prevent us from appreciating  the intersection in the vessels’ production.

    "As we consider the question of economic complexity, it is significant that the products of multiple Palestinian workshops made their way to Kenchreai. We tentatively suggest that this makes any direct institutional or private connection between Palestine and Kenchreai unlikely. This is not “tied trade” in which goods are mobilized by a landowner with interests in both regions.48 Instead, goods are on the move because of the cumulative demand of Aegean consumers in combination with the relatively dominant market at Constantinople, which by the late sixth century was home to the largest concentration of mouths to feed.49 Further highlighting the strong connection between the Corinthia and Palestine at this time is the rare occurrence of so-called “Palestinian String Cut Casseroles” among the finds from the Threpsiades complex.50 It will be interesting to produce a complete count of this vessel type in relation to more regional utilitarian vessels.Source: Preliminary Report on Early Byzantine Pottery from a Building Complex at Kenchreai.

This one locus of activity at Early Byzantine Kenchreai has a place in the regional narrative of long-term change.51 The construction of the Hexamilion, a defensive wall stretching across the Isthmus not far north of the harbor, in the early fifth century signals the evolving strategic circumstances of the Empire. Justinian (527-565) initiated a campaign of repair to the Isthmian fortifications and the addition of towers. This massive operation precedes by perhaps only a few decades the activity at Kenchreai represented by the finewares and amphoras from Threpsiades. Justinian’s military construction anticipated the real threat of incursion by the Avars and Slavs in the 580s. We use the generic term “Slavs” for new settlers whose arrival in Macedonia, central Greece, and the Peloponnese from the northern Balkans marked new circumstances for local communities.52 The main port on the closest major Saronic island, Aegina, sustained a sizable community represented by monumental architecture and a diverse range of artifacts into the seventh century.Source: Preliminary Report on Early Byzantine Pottery from a Building Complex at Kenchreai.

    "Only a few kilometers north of Kenchreai, the coastal establishment at Akra Sophia was active during the sixth century and probably into the seventh.54 The published LRA2 and beehive sherds, together with scattered fineware and structural remains, suggest this was a rural villa of sorts with opulent residential space and a small harborage, combining luxurious living with commercial engagement.55 Moreover, the countryside north and west of Kenchreai and across the central Isthmus has been systematically explored by the Eastern Korinthia Archaeological Survey in 1999-2002.56 Close analysis of surface ceramics has led to the conclusion that this rural space remained economically vibrant throughout the sixth century and that such activity then diminished over the course of the seventh and eighth.5Source: Preliminary Report on Early Byzantine Pottery from a Building Complex at Kenchreai.

    "By the middle to late sixth century, the commercial capacity of the port at Kenchreai was declining from its Early to Middle Roman heyday. Alterations to the Fountain Court in which the glass opus sectile panels had once been stored are one step within a sequence of rebuilding that impinged upon the first-century commercial horrea, or storerooms, fronting the south pier.58 A late fifth or early sixth-century church dominated the landward end of this mole, and it is unclear to what degree the south harbor was still accessible for mooring. It also seems that the two moles were submerged during coseismic subsidence in Late Antiquity, thus permanently altering the built landscape of the port. Nonetheless, the protected shoreline and any extant facilities between Kenchreai’s moles would have still allowed the loading and unloading of ships from the Late Roman to Early Byzantine periods.Source: Preliminary Report on Early Byzantine Pottery from a Building Complex at Kenchreai.

    "Within this setting, the Threpsiades complex provides rich evidence for local, if fleeting, prosperity and connectivity to an economic network. In this regard, the building’s situation so close to the waterfront is significant: it would have had direct or near direct access to maritime traffic, even if the structure was in partial ruin during its final years. It also must have been close to the main road heading inland toward Corinth. The Early Byzantine pottery kept inside such an advantageously located building illustrates a nexus of two-way trade, and it may capture a moment or trace a sequence in the decline of that trade. We suspect that many of the LRA2s, particularly the large ones, were destined to be shipped out from Kenchreai, perhaps containing Corinthian commodities. The ships that would have carried them away may well have been the same ones that brought the eastern amphoras, the ARS and the PRS, and glass vessels to the port.

    "Such imports could have been sent off to consumers on coastal or rural settlements, such as the villas at Akra Sophia or on the central Isthmus, or the larger market at Corinth. It is hard to know whether the end of storing and pouring in the Threpsiades complex at some point in the early seventh century was a seminal event in the life of the harbor or a symptom of more generalized changes. In any case, no one maintained the building for continued use after this time. Further study of this important building and all its contents will help us to understand better just what that use was.

    "The shipwreck has been dated around 60 1 A consensus does not exist on the question whether the Mechanism was built around that time or significantly earlier.2 After twenty centuries under water, it is incomplete, and broken into several fragments.The extant fragments are nevertheless enough for reconstructing the main structure and functions of the mechanism: it had several pointers, interconnected and worked by toothed gearing, showing the positions of the moon and sun (and probably also the planets) in the zodiac, the approximate date according to a lunisolar calendar, several subsidiary dials showing calendrical phenomena, and also predictions of eclipses.3  #p1 n nThe longitudes of the sun and moon were shown on a single dial with two concentric rings: the inner one was divided into the twelve zodiac signs of 30 degrees each, and the outer one into 12 months of 30 days each plus five epagomenal days that constitute a year according to the Egyptian calendar.

    "One pointer rotated one turn per year, showing the position of the sun in the zodiac; probably the same pointer4 showed also the day in the calendar ring. A second pointer rotated one turn per sidereal month, showing the position of the moon in the zodiac.  #p2 n nThe moon pointer included a delightful and prominent detail, partially conserved in the back of Fragment See Figure 1.One half of a small ball was seen in a small circular window.

    "The ball was half pale and half dark, and it rotated with the lunar synodic period and so showed the phases of the moon.The device was mounted on a small cap, rotating with the lunar sidereal period, to which the (lost) moon pointer was probably attached.See Figure 2.The moon ball was connected to a contrate gear through an arbor.This contrate was driven, either directly or indirectly, by a gear rotating with the solar period. Source: The moon phase anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism. Carman and Di Cocco. ISAW Papers, 11 (2016)",
    "Consequently the ensemble functioned as a differential gear, so that the contrate u2013and with it the little ball u2013 rotated at a rate that was the difference between those of the sun and the moon pointers.Its period of rotation was therefore the synodic period, representing the elongation of the moon from the sun.  #p3 n nNot having understood the detail of this assembly, Derek de Solla Price (1974: 20) suggested two possible functions for it: 1) it could be  u201csome part of the dial work for the center of the front dial, possibly a plate indicating the position of the Moon u201d or 2)  u201ca crank handle ... that drives the contrate wheel A u201d. (This refers not to the contrate in Fragment C, of which Price was unaware, but another contrate in Fragment ) Price's first proposal was close to the truth, but he related the device only the moon's position, not with the moon's phases. Source: The moon phase anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism. Carman and Di Cocco. ISAW Papers, 11 (2016)",
    "In any case, Price only mentioned these possibilities, without developing them any further.  #p4 n nMichael Wright presented a reconstruction of the component as the boss of the pointer for the Moon u2019s position, incorporating a display of the Moon u2019s phase,5 and since then scholars have universally accepted this reconstruction.It could not have been otherwise, because Wright's proposal makes perfect sense and it fits very well with the physical evidence of the extant cap: even to the naked eye, it is easy to see not only the circular window, but also a smooth hemispherical depression behind the circular hole that strongly suggests that the hole was once filled by the small lunar ball. Source: The moon phase anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism. Carman and Di Cocco. ISAW Papers, 11 (2016)",
    "The arbor connecting the place of the ball with the contrate gear is also there, and even around half of the contrate.There is further evidence confirming Wright's proposal, for in the portion of the Back Cover Inscription preserved on Fragment B of the Mechanism a   small golden sphere   probably refers to the sun, while in a more broken context that was probably describing the lunar display another   small sphere   is mentioned with which the word  u201cblack u201d is most likely associated.6  #p5 n nHowever, the contrate is found with its teeth pointing away from the centre of the cap, not towards it as Wright u2019s reconstruction requires (see Figure 3). Source: The moon phase anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism. Carman and Di Cocco. ISAW Papers, 11 (2016)",
    "Wright suggests that this component, as found, had been inserted the wrong way round:  u201cIt seems therefore that the Antikythera Mechanism suffered the indignity, depressingly common in the author u2019s experience as curator of a collection of mechanism, of having been taken apart and reassembled incorrectly u201d (Wright 2006: 327).  #p6 n nTony Freeth has proposed an alternative solution according to which the gear, as found, is correctly placed.7 Two more gears are added, connecting the contrate gear (with its teeth pointing away from the axis) to a gear fixed on the solar axis (see Figure 4). Source: The moon phase anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism. Carman and Di Cocco. ISAW Papers, 11 (2016)",
    "Gear u is fixed to the solar axis and therefore rotates with the solar period.Gear u moves x which has the same number of teeth, so that it rotates at the same rate but in the opposite direction.Gear y, which is fixed to x, rotating at the same rate, has the same number of teeth as the contrate (z) with which it is engaged.This device produces exactly the same result as Wright u2019s proposal, while allowing the teeth of the contrate to be in the extant direction.  #p7 n nFreeth's proposal is the simplest solution to the problem if, as we will show, there are compelling reasons to consider that the incorrect reassembly proposal should be discarded. Source: The moon phase anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism. Carman and Di Cocco. ISAW Papers, 11 (2016)",
    "But an obvious question still remains: why would the Antikythera Mechanism's maker prefer this more complicated solution to the simpler one proposed by Wright?We know from many other features of the mechanism that the builder was very smart, and reasonably minimalist, even using in several instances parts of the same gear train for different purposes.Therefore, there must be a reason for using four instead of two gears.  #p8 n nIn this paper, we will offer for the first time a detailed description of the remains of the moon ball mechanism as it can be seen in the CT data, trying to make sense of every feature (section 1).

    "This depression, however, is less regular and not as well aligned as the previous one, so it may be just a random irregularity.   #p20 n nInside the arbor window and between the two cheeks and their holders is another component that kept the arbor in place.We will call it the arbor keeper pipe, or simply, the pipe (violet in the diagram of Figure 5).This pipe has a complex shape (somewhat similar to a tobacco pipe with a bowl) that makes it fit perfectly in the space left by the moon window, the cheeks and holders (see Figure 17).

    "As we already mentioned, the contrate gear must rotate with the lunar synodic period.The gear is attached to the arbor through a pin and so the arbor also rotates at the same rate.The arbor is held by pipe and transmits its rotation to the moon ball.  #p23 n nWe will propose a way in which all the parts of the mechanism can be assembled and disassembled that is consistent with the description of the parts and makes sense of some apparently unnecessary complexities in certain pieces (such as the particular shape of the cheeks or of the pipe).

    "See animation 2.In order to disassemble the mechanism:  #p24 n nYou first have to detach the moon ball.The moon ball was presumably attached to the the part of the arbor inserted in it just by friction or possibly a screw fitting.The small semicircular slot at the moon ball depression where the arbor should go inside the ball (Figure 16) shows that the arbor was still cylindrical when went inside the ball (this would have allowed one to twist the ball by hand when the apparatus was assembled and all the gears connected, in order to set up the correct phase).

    "Because the moon ball is smaller than the moon ball window, the ball could be taken off by drawing it in the opposite direction of the arbor. n nThen you have to remove the pin that goes through the holders and the pipe.Steps 1 and 2 could be reversed, but both must be completed before step 3. n nThe third step consists in removing the entire apparatus: i.e., the pipe with the arbor and the contrate.

    "The walls of the pipe are as wide as the space left by the third section of the moon window, but the window is partially closed by the cheeks, which thus prevent the pipe from being pushed through to the inner side of the plate.On the other hand, the wings of the pipe prevent it from being pushed through towards the outer side of the plate.Consequently, even if the pin is removed, the pipe cannot be moved up or down.

    "But, now that the pin and the moon ball have been removed, the pipe can be slid in the direction of the moon window using the protruded part of the cheeks as guides.If the pipe is moved in this way until it abuts the rim of the cap, the part of the shank of the pipe that has wings would be now partially in the moon ball window and partially in the part of the third section window where the holders are, and so the cheeks would not stand in the way of moving the pipe to the outer side of the plate.

    "It is important to realize that even now it can only be removed in the direction of the outer part and not towards the inner part of the plate, because the shank still is wider than the space left by the cheeks. n nOnce the pipe, together with the arbor and the gear, has been removed from the moon cap, you can extract the arbor by drawing it in the direction of the gear (you cannot remove it in the other direction because the squared collar obstructs it). n nFinally you can remove the pin that fixes the gear to the arbor and take off the gear (the order of steps 4 and 5 can be reversed).

    "The whole mechanism is now disassembled.You can reassemble the mechanism following the steps in the reverse order. n nSection 2: the direction of the contrate gear n nIn this section we will analyse in detail whether, as Wright suggested, the contrate gear was reassembled incorrectly so that the actual direction of the contrate gear is not the originally intended one, or whether the extant direction was the intended one so that we would have to postulate (at a minimum) two extra gears to connect the contrate gear to the Sun's arbor, as Freeth suggested.  #p25 n nWe note in passing that that the supposed incorrect assembly must have taken place before the discovery of the shipwreck and not, say, during handling or conservation of the fragment at the Museum.

    "The earliest known photograph of the face of Fragment C bearing the Moon phase apparatus, published by Svoronos in 1903, shows it before any conservation work had been done on it, and the contrate gear is clearly visible pointing in the extant direction (see Figure 18).It also seems very unlikely that an inversion of the gear could have happened during the shipwreck or during the time the Mechanism was under the sea. Source: The moon phase anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism. Carman and Di Cocco. ISAW Papers, 11 (2016)",
    "The perfect alignment of the pinhole of the arbor and the pin slot of the contrate on one side, and the almost perfect alignment of the two pieces of the arbor on each side of the break make the notion that the contrate gear was somehow flipped around just by chance highly implausible.The incorrect assembly must have taken place before the shipwreck, when the Mechanism was essentially intact.  #p26 n nIn Figure 19 we schematically represent the parts that would play a role in this analysis in the extant position, i.e., with the contrate gear teeth facing the moon ball.  #p27 n nIf one wants to assert that the gear has been reversed before the shipwreck there are three options. Source: The moon phase anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism. Carman and Di Cocco. ISAW Papers, 11 (2016)",
    "The first two can be easily dismissed by consideration of the evidence, but the third one will require a more detailed analysis.The first option consists of reconstructing the intended arrangement of the moon phase mechanism by leaving all as in Figure 19 except the gear, which would face the other way around.But, as is evident from Figure 20, if you keep the pinhole of the arbor aligned with the slot of the gear so that the pin can be inserted, the gear would not fit inside the gear-window of the moon cap. Source: The moon phase anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism. Carman and Di Cocco. ISAW Papers, 11 (2016)",
    "An additional problem is that the gear would be too close to the sun axis to leave room for a gear with the same number of teeth that would move the contrate gear.  #p28 n nThe second option assumes that the collar was movable.According to this possibility, the collar would have originally been between the contrate and edge a of the window.This option would make all the components fit within the cap window. Source: The moon phase anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism. Carman and Di Cocco. ISAW Papers, 11 (2016)",
    "The collar would have had to have a hole for a pin (d in Figure 21) that, passing through the collar and the extant pinhole of the arbor, would fix the collar.Also, the arbor would have to have had another pinhole (e in Figure 21) for a second pin that, passing through it and the rectangular slot in the gear, would prevent the gear from moving to the right.The absence of any traces of a boundary between the collar and the arbor, and above all of a second pinhole in the arbor at e or of a pinhole through the collar rules out this option, since, as previously noted, the pinholes in the Mechanism are conspicuous in the CT whether their pins are still present or not.  #p29 n nThe third option takes advantage of the break between surfaces b and c. Source: The moon phase anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism. Carman and Di Cocco. ISAW Papers, 11 (2016)",
    "According to this proposal, in its original position the gear was reversed together with the broken part of the arbor between a and b and the collar attached to it (see Figure 22).Through some accident the arbor was broken, and after this happened, someone put the broken piece with the contrate back in its part of the window pointing the wrong way.  #p30 n nThe main problems that we find with this proposal are the following. Source: The moon phase anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism. Carman and Di Cocco. ISAW Papers, 11 (2016)",
    "First, a close inspection of the CT tends to confirm that there is a reasonably good matching break between b and c.See Figure 23.  #p31 n nSecond, in the incorrect assembly hypothesis the most reasonable reconstruction suggests that the squared collar would have been at the left extremity of the arbor.Because the collar was one piece with the arbor, it doesn u2019t make sense for the arbor to protrude beyond the collar. Source: The moon phase anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism. Carman and Di Cocco. ISAW Papers, 11 (2016)",
    "Hence the little window that we identified as the first section of the big window would be pointless, as shown in Figure 24:  #p32 n nOn the other hand, according to the hypothesis that the contrate is preserved in its intended orientation, it is perfectly reasonable for a bit of the arbor to protrude beyond the gear window so that the pinhole in the arbor does not have to be too close to its end and so more liable to damage. Source: The moon phase anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism. Carman and Di Cocco. ISAW Papers, 11 (2016)",
    "The fact that the gear, instead of having a hole for the pin, has a slot could indicate that a hole so close to the edge would be very fragile.The same would be the case with an arbor that was as long as the gear, but not more.  #p33 n nThird, if the pinhole of the arbor was so close to the break, one would have expected the arbor have broken through the pinhole, since this was the most fragile part the arbor.  #p34 n nFourth, there are distinct remains of the cylindrical arbor at the collar. Source: The moon phase anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism. Carman and Di Cocco. ISAW Papers, 11 (2016)",
    "In the following CT image the circle left by the joining of the squared collar and the cylindrical arbor is perfectly identifiable.It is clear from the CT that we are seeing surface b and not surface c.  #p35 n nFifth, a close inspection of the break shows that it probably includes some little parts of the pipe itself, and not just the arbor.It would be very hard to explain on the incorrect reassembly hypothesis why the little broken pieces of the pipe are still in place. Source: The moon phase anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism. Carman and Di Cocco. ISAW Papers, 11 (2016)",
    "These broken parts of the pipe can be observed in two places.See Figure 26 and Figure 27.  #p36 n nSixth, if the contrate originally faced the center of the moon cap and then you attempted to reverse its orientation, the teeth of the gear attached to the solar arbor that originally moved the contrate would obstruct replacing the moon cap in its original place, because the back of the contrate would collide with its teeth.9 So, there are three possibilities. Source: The moon phase anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism. Carman and Di Cocco. ISAW Papers, 11 (2016)",
    "One is that the moon cap was never reinstalled on the Mechanism after the contrate gear was unintentionally reversed.But this is implausible, first because the moon cap is extant in fragment C, close to the zodiac and calendar rings, and second because the cap faces in the correct direction with respect to the outer part of the mechanism and the inscribed part of the rings face, which seems to indicate that it was in place at the moment of the shipwreck. Source: The moon phase anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism. Carman and Di Cocco. ISAW Papers, 11 (2016)",
    "Secondly, someone might have tried to force the cap into place, causing still more damage (as suggested by Wright 2006: 327), but this requires that the person responsible, feeling the resistance, was too careless to look for what was wrong and notice the obvious fact that the contrate was facing the wrong way to engage with the other gear.The third possibility is that the moon cap was indeed reassembled, but the gear attached to the solar arbor was for some unexplained reason also missing, but this is clearly an ad hoc hypothesis. (This objection would also apply to the second hypothesis involving a removable collar and second pin.)  #p37 n nSeventh, we should ask how it is that the broken part is in its place, so very well aligned with the rest of the arbor. Source: The moon phase anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism. Carman and Di Cocco. ISAW Papers, 11 (2016)",
    "We know that the part of the arbor closer to the moon ball was kept in place by the pipe, but the broken part of the arbor, the collar and the contrate gear itself would have had nothing to keep them in place.They ought to have fallen out.  #p38 n nThese are the main difficulties of the incorrect assembly hypothesis.But our proposal also presents at least one difficulty with respect to the physical remains. Source: The moon phase anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism. Carman and Di Cocco. ISAW Papers, 11 (2016)",
    "If the extant position is the intended one, we have to postulate some additional lost gearwork to connect the solar arbor's motion to the contrate, most plausibly two extra gears, as Freeth suggested.But it seems that there is no trace of the loss of a part on which the arbor for the two extra gears could have been planted, and it is reasonable to think that it should have left a detectable trace. Source: The moon phase anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism. Carman and Di Cocco. ISAW Papers, 11 (2016)",
    "Based on his own study of the original fragment C, Wright has made the same point in connection with both Freeth u2019s reconstruction and the one discussed here (private communication).However, we see two possible ways that the extra gears could have been mounted, either by a platform soldered to the top faces of the cheeks (see Figure 29) or by an attachment to the curb whose footprint remains on the plate (see Figure 28).  #p39 n nA further reason for suspecting the presence of the two gears (or at least of something where the two extra gears should be) is the way in which the pipe is assembled and disassembled.

    "We have already explained that, while the pin of the pipe must be removed from the inner part of the cap, the pipe has been designed in such a way that it could only be removed towards the outer part of the cap.In principle it would have been easier to remove both pieces from the same side.So, the fact that the pipe was designed to be removed to the outer face of the cap strongly suggests the presence of something in the inner part, blocking the passage of the pipe.

    "See again animation 3 which is essentially similar to animation 2, but with the proposed gears added.  #p40 n nIn conclusion, all the evidence seems to indicate that the arbor was broken after the shipwreck and that the extant position is the original and intended position.In what follows I will show that the Antikythera mechanism's maker could have had a good reason for putting the gear in this position.  #p41 n nSection 3: non-uniform motion of the moon phase ball. n nFreeth u2019s proposal consists of two pairs of gears having an equal number of teeth.

    "Fortunately, we have another example of this in the mechanism: the pin and slot device for producing the lunar anomalistic motion.The pin and slot device does not change the period of rotation, but produces a non-uniform motion in the output gear (see Figure 30).Gears z and y have the same number of teeth, as do gears u and x. u moves x by engagement, and x moves y by means of a pin inserted in a slot of y.

    "Therefore, x and y rotate at the same rate but, because y is eccentric with respect to x, its motion is not uniform.This non-uniform motion is transmitted by engagement from y to z.Consequently z rotates at the same rate as u, but with a non-uniform motion.The amplitude of the non-uniformity depends on the eccentricity and its period is the period of rotation of x and y.  #p42 n nProposals have recently been published for extending the pin and slot device to produce the retrograde motion of outer and inner planets.10 It is thus possible that the pin and slot device was not exclusively employed for the lunar anomaly.

    "If the designer intended to model some anomalistic period in the rotation of the moon ball, through the use of a pin and slot device, we would have an explanation for the presence of the two extra gears of Freeth u2019s arrangement (see Figure 31).  #p43 n nThis conjectural pin-and-slot device would produce an anomaly with period equal to the synodic month in the rotation of the moon phase ball, without affecting the motion of the moon pointer (i.e., the lunar sidereal motion). Source: The moon phase anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism. Carman and Di Cocco. ISAW Papers, 11 (2016)",
    "So, we should ask: do we know of any ancient report of some sort of anomaly in the lunar phases with a period of a synodic month, independent of the lunar sidereal motion?  #p44 n nThe answer is affirmative.We know from Aristarchus of Samos u2019s On Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon (Heath 1913) that, if we accept that the ratio between the Earth-Sun distance and the Earth-Moon distance is not too great, there would be a perceptible inequality in the moon u2019s phases.

    "Aristarchus distinguished the dichotomy (when the boundary between the moon's dark and illuminated parts appears to be a straight line) from the quadrature (when the moon is exactly 90 u00b0 elongation from the sun).According to Aristarchus, the dichotomy is not produced at quadrature, but 3 u00b0 earlier at first quarter and 3 u00b0 later at last quarter (see Figure 32).  #p45 n nIf this appearance were to be modelled in the mechanism, the motion of the moon ball would have to be non-uniform: it should take more time to go from the first dichotomy to second dichotomy than from second to first. Source: The moon phase anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism. Carman and Di Cocco. ISAW Papers, 11 (2016)",
    "The difference between these two intervals, according to Aristarchus u2019s proposal, would be around 1 day.  #p46 n nAristarchus u2019s ratio between the Earth-Sun distance and the Earth-Moon distance is not the only one attested in ancient texts, and in fact, together with that of Ptolemy (for whom it was almost the same), it is one of the greatest.Of course, the smaller the ratio, the bigger the effect. Source: The moon phase anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism. Carman and Di Cocco. ISAW Papers, 11 (2016)",
    "So, for example, for Eudoxus the ratio was 9:1, implying a difference between quadrature and dichotomy of more than 6 u00b0; for Phidias, Archimedes u2019s father, 12:1, implying a difference of almost 5 u00b0; for Eratosthenes the ratio is a bit bigger than 5:1, implying a difference of almost 11 u00b0; and for Hipparchus, it is approximately 7:1, implying a difference of almost 8 u00b0.11 See the following animation based on Phidias u2019s proportion.  #p47 n nA one-day difference could be observed on the Mechanism.

    "One would move the moon pointer until the moon ball shows the dichotomy, note which day is indicated on the Egyptian calendar scale (or on the day-of-the-month display, if such display existed, as has been proposed)12, then crank the mechanism forward to the next dichotomy and check the date.Of course, a crucial question is whether it could be possible to distinguish the dichotomy on the moon ball within one single day.

    "Two independent observations have been made with different reconstructions of the mechanism, and in both cases the answer was positive.13 Moreover, the observations have been made assuming the maximum attested ratio of the distances (that of Aristarchus), but if the ratio between the distances was smaller, then the effect would be even greater and, therefore, easier to be detected.  #p48 n nWe must stress that if the Mechanism's designer adopted Freeth's extra pair of gears, or indeed any means of transmitting motion from the solar arbor to the moon ball's arbor that was more complicated than the obvious direct engagement of the contrate with the fixed gear as proposed by Wright, it must have been intended somehow to modify the motion that direct engagement would have produced.

(Strictly, we should not speak without qualification of a change from uniform to non-uniform motion, since the elongation displayed on the Mechanism was already affected by the lunar anomaly, though likely not by the solar anomaly14.)

    "Incorporating this effect would have provided a way of including one of the main topics of ancient astronomy at least since Aristotle u2019s time, the distances of the luminaries, which would not otherwise have been present in the mechanism.Their relative distances would have been displayed qualitatively by the fact that the moon ball was closer to the dial's center (representing the earth) than the   golden little sphere   that apparently was mounted on the sun's pointer, but it would have been impracticable to set these spheres at the assumed ratio of their distances.

    "Greater precision typically means specifying longitudes of heavenly bodies and astrologically significant points in degrees (with or without fractions) rather than just by zodiacal signs.Additional data may be strictly astronomical, such as latitudes of heavenly bodies, cardines other than the ascendant, or dates and longitudes of syzygies close to the birthdate, or astrological, such as lots and dignities.2 A few types of additional data, for example cardines or house rulers, may appear in horoscopes that specify only zodiacal signs without degrees, but most depended on knowledge of precise longitudes in degrees, and hence only appear in horoscopes that also give that additional precision in the longitudes.  #p2 n nFour papyrus horoscopes in Neugebauer and Van Hoesen u2019s Greek Horoscopes, all for birthdates within a span of about a half century from the late first century CE to the mid second, exemplify a loose genre that can be characterized as  u201celaborate u201d or  u201cdeluxe u201d horoscopes (years cited in this paper are CE unless otherwise indicated):3  #p3 n nP.Lond. 1.130 (Hor. gr. 81.III.31 = GH 81), 81 April 1 n nP.Lond. 1.98 (Hor. gr. 95.IV.13 = GH 95), 95 April 13 n nP.Lond. 1.110 and Paris 19 (Hor. gr. 137.XII.4 = GH 137b and 137a), 137 December 4 n nP.Paris 19bis (Hor. gr. 137.XII.4 = GH 137c), 137 December 4 n n(Lond.

    "On the other hand, the tables for the Sun and Moon appear to have had similar systematic errors to Ptolemys.Perhaps the composer of the horoscope used tables from different sources for the luminaries and for the planets.An alternative possibility worth exploring is that the longitudes in the horoscope are in a sidereal frame of reference.Abundant evidence exists that when Ptolemys tables were used for astrological purposes during the third and fourth centuries, the tropical longitudes obtained from the tables were generally converted to sidereal by adding 8u00b0 minus one-eightieth of a degree for every year since 158 BCE, a formula explicitly reported by Theon of Alexandria as employed by the  astrologers of old. 14 For the nativity date, the value of this correction would have been approximately +2u00b0 3', an amount that would more or less cancel out the error of Ptolemys tropical frame of reference.

XXXV of the Liber Hermetis52 but these seem to be the monomoiriai by triplicity (also covered in Paulus,  Ch. 32).In original documentary horoscopes, the calculation of the monomoiria is rare.We find it calculated for the Midheaven, Lower midheaven, Lot of Fortune and Lot of Daimon in one  deluxe horoscope,  Oxy. astr. 4277 (Hor. gr. 150-250b).53 In the Eutocius horoscope monomoiriai are calculated for all five planets and the two luminaries, the prenatal full Moon, the Ascendant, Midheaven, Lot of Fortune and Lot of Daimon.

Olympiodorus (Ch. 20; Boer 1962: 41.12-20) uses the example of an Ascendant at Scorpio 20u00b0.Multiplying 20u00b0 by 13 = 260u00b0.Add that to the beginning of Scorpio, i.e. 210u00b0: 260u00b0 + 210u00b0 = 470u00b0. 470 - 360 = 110u00b0, or Cancer 20u00b0.

    "After its reintroduction, the antoninianus quickly became the most frequently appearing coinage in finds from the mid- and late-third century throughout the western Empire. I will come back to this point in the interpretation section, but for now it is useful to separate the antoniniani found in Africa from the other coins.For, the 230s CE represent a transitional time between the stable, tri-metallic monetary system (namely, coins minted in gold, silver, and bronze) in effect for most of the imperial period and the reformed coinage of the late third century CE.  #p18 n nNot including antoniniani, there are 13,477 imperial coins known from North Africa from the period under consideration here.

    "The chief reason that ancient hoards went un-collected is that the people who buried it moved away or died before they had a chance to recover the material, spend it, move it, or melt it down for its metal; and the most common cause of this in antiquity was warfare.In other words, the number of coins found in a given region, especially those found in hoards, can be a strong positive proxy for the level of military and political turmoil in that region.20  #p20 n nThis is not to say that hoarding itself was driven solely by warfare, that people would bury coins out of fear of invading troops.

    "Moreover, the relative economic stability enjoyed by the region would have contributed to this pattern for similar reasons, for a stable monetary economy means that coins retain their value for longer periods, so that they are less 'expendable' and so do not become stray finds and so hoards containing those coins remain 'worth recovering'. I treat the important topic of recoverability in more detail below.  #p21 n nConcerning the evidence that we do have, as is immediately apparent from Table 2, of coins minted before 235 CE, the denarius and sestertius are by far the most frequently occurring in the evidence, representing 45% and 49% of the total, respectively.

    "The crucial point here is that both of these markers of stability are not echoed by the numismatic record of northern Europe.This picture is further confirmed by the circulation life of the coins found in Africa compared with those from Gaul.Admittedly, the notion that Roman Africa had a thriving economy for most of the imperial period is not an entirely novel one.The reason that the evidence presented here is important is in providing confirmation that the general impression given by other types of material from the region such as textual and epigraphic records; namely, that Africas market activity required a significant amount of coinage to pay wages, buy materials, and invest into the production of a variety of consumer goods.39 Furthermore, the suggestion that the African economy remained productive even during the turmoil of the mid-third century CE and that economic and financial difficulties were lower than in in the region than in other parts of the western Empire are perhaps more contentious ideas, yet they are certainly supported by the numismatic evidence.  c) Regional Patterns  Figure 6.

    "There are also certain historical reasons that could explain this geographical patterning.As Salama recently noted, Algerian hoards have produced a greater number of coins from the imperial period than any other country in North Africa.He attributes this largely to the military unrest which occurred in southern Numidia in the 250s CE as a result of invading tribes from the Atlas Mountain range.41 Indeed, Salama notes that 14 hoards found in Algeria and Morocco have terminal dates in the 250s and are mainly comprised of coins from the high Empire, namely minted before 235 CE.

    "This suggests that the unrest of the 250s led to much insecurity and, therefore, an increased preponderance of non-recovered hoarding.Moreover, the fact that the regions hoards are so heavily weighted with coins minted before 235 CE indicates also that the turmoil led to a disruption in the distribution of coins from the mint at Rome, which fits with evidence from other regions of the Empire, discussed below.

    "The idea is not that coins did not circulate in other regions, rather that there would have been less unrecovered hoards in the more peaceful regions, meaning fewer of these coins will have been unrecovered and so available for discovery by modern archaeology.This line of thought, however, begs the question of why Mauretania Caesariensis and Tingitana have produced so few coins, since the tribal revolts of the 250s affected these areas as much as, if not more than, western Numidia?source: An Overview of the Numismatic Evidence from Imperial Roman Africa.

    "Particularly confusing, and also intriguing, about the geographical distribution of coin finds is that the pattern of pre-235 CE coins does not persist when post-235 coins are included.When all coins minted in the high imperial period are considered, Africa Proconsularis becomes by far the most well represented province with 18,107 examples, 54% of the 33,514 coins known from all of Africa (Table 5a).

    "An intriguing alternative explanation is that, while turmoil may represent one significant factor in the recovery rate of coins from a given area, the general monetary and economic health of that region may be equally important.Exploring the context of coin finds from Roman Africa offers some hint at how this model may help explain the patterns observed here.  d) Contextual Patterns The final pattern I will comment on is the context in which African coins were foundu2014in a hoard or as a site find.

    "Generally, large numbers of coins grouped togetheru2014hoardsu2014typically represent the accumulated wealth of an individual, family, or a group like a military legion or trade organization, and generally are made up of the highest-valued coins available to the hoarder.Conversely, site finds represent the lower-valued coins in circulation and are, in essence, 'loose change' lost or discarded during everyday activity and not recovered because the loss was unknown or was not worth the effort to recover. A relatively low but steady loss-rate of low denomination coins, thus, fits with the idea that Africa enjoyed a well-functioning monetized economy; an economy featuring, on the one hand, enough small-scale activity so that enough of such coins were in demand that they were lost and unrecovered with some regularity, yet, on the other hand, there was a high enough need for the coins that they were not discarded in any large quantity.

    "Contrarily, higher value currency such as the silver denarius was useful as a store of value or for large-scale activity such as state expenditure or the exchange of luxury or bulk goods, things which occur less frequently than smaller-scale expenses and which require the accumulation of large groups of coins.This would explain why denarii are most commonly found in hoards.Sestertii, then, exist on the border of the two categories, for they are useful both in daily transactions such as paying wages on a local scale or for buying modest quantities of consumer goods, but also seem to have functioned as a store of value.

    "Consistent with this, we see sestertii from North Africa found in relatively large numbers in hoards but also showing up as site finds.This also explains Africa's denominational patterns discussed above: a relatively stable supply of very low value bronze asses as site finds up to the late second century; a fairly steady loss rate of the medium-value bronze sestertii throughout the imperial period; and an increasing number of high-value silver denarii being lost over the course of the second century leading up to the introduction of the antoninianus in the mid-third century.

    "Moreover, it is important to stress that most of the known hoards have terminal dates after 235 CE, namely 52 (68%).44 This means that the majority of the hoards known from Africa which contain imperial coinage were hoarded after 235 CE, a pattern that largely mimics that known from northern Europe.This may seem to lend support to the notion that some turmoil in the mid-third century caused a massive increase in the frequency of hoarding throughout Africa.

    "The question may fairly be asked whether it is worthwhile at all to even include evidence from site finds in such a numismatic overview.There is, in fact, great scholarly debate over exactly how to treat individual coins recovered as site finds, especially regarding the extent to which the stray finds of any given archaeological site reflect a true cross-section of the coinage which actually circulated during a given period.48 The problem is essentially the opposite of the issues with hoarded coins; coins lost accidentally or casually thrown away are generally the lowest denomination, most heavily worn coins in circulation at a given time and place.

    "The picture that emerges from a study of stray finds, then, is strongly biased towards low value currency, whereas it is typically the highest value, heaviest, most pristine examples available to a person which are hoarded.Moreover, the number of site finds from a given area depends in large part on the number of large-scale excavations conducted in that area, whereas hoards are often found even without the deliberate exertion of effort to find them.

    "Consequently, the focus of numismatic scholarship has traditionally been on hoarded coins, as hoards have been the most widely available and accessible context producing Roman coins.In a very important article, Reece argued that site finds should be subjected to closer scholarly scrutiny than they have in the past.49 He notes that there are 3 basic assumptions that make excavated, stray coinage suitable to analysis: first, that in a well conducted excavation, the coins uncovered will be close to the actual amount of coin loss at the site in antiquity; second, that the coins lost on a site must bear some relationship to the coinage in circulation at any given period, even if the precise relationship is not immediately apparent; and lastly, that it is possible to discern the major factors which produce stray coin finds. Source: An Overview of the Numismatic Evidence from Imperial Roman Africa. Daniel Hoyer. ISAW Papers 13 (2018)",
    "He expands on this third point, noting that a coin is most likely to be lost and unrecovered on a particular site: a) when it is among the least valuable coins in circulation; b) when it is small compared to other examples of the same type (which likewise has to do with the coins value, since smaller coins contain less metal); c) when it is dull, namely heavily worn; d) when there are more of that type of coin circulating than other types; and e) when there is more money in general circulating at the site than at other sites, i.e. that the loss rate of coins is related to the overall level of monetization.50 These arguments convincingly show that it is necessary to include analyses of site finds in order to judge what patterns these coins exhibited and how those patterns relate to the hoarded material, as long as the distinction between these radically different contexts is properly maintained.

    "In terms of chronological arrangement, the site finds and hoarded material exhibit roughly the same pattern, with the majority of coins recovered as site finds minted in the third century CE.The denominational pattern is a little different, for site finds nearly always feature a greater concentration of lower value coinage than the hoarded material, as expected.While antoniniani comprise the majority of both hoard and site finds, they make up only 32% of the site finds, but 61% of the hoarded material.

    "This is because, as Reece notes, typically the lowest coinage in circulation at any given site at any given time will be lost in greatest quantity, so a change in the denominational pattern of lost coins over time will indicate something about the areas monetary history.51 Figure 8 offers a comparison between the chronological distribution of the as, dupondius, sestertius, denarius, and antoninianus from site finds versus hoards.

    "These graphs reveal some change over time, as the frequency with which asses and dupondii, relatively low-value coins, were lost sharply decreases after the 160s CE, while the loss rate of the denarius increases fairly steadily over time.Curiously, the sestertius loss rate does not mirror that of the denarius, but sestertii are lost at a fairly steady rate during most of the Antonine period as well as the late Severan period.

    "This again suggests that Africa experienced some inflation after the 160s, since the increasing frequency of denarius losses coupled with the increasing rarity of losses of fractional bronzes suggests that the coin was progressively losing purchasing power and, thus, were becoming more 'losable'.This notion, however, is somewhat belied by the fact that sestertii continued to be lost at a steady rate along with denarii in the early third century.

    "Perhaps the best explanation is that the region experienced an initial period of inflation in the later half of the second century CE, but that currency values more or less leveled off and remained fairly stable for the next 150 years.Once more, this pattern is fruitfully compared to the situation in northern Europe.Post-Antonine period finds in the Gallic provinces are very rare, which includes site finds as well as hoards.

    "This has been convincingly interpreted52 as the result of fairly drastic debasements to the currency, resulting in a relatively severe degree of currency inflation, if not general price inflation.Such inflation would not only prompt the lower value denominations to be minted less frequently, but also could be the cause of the nearly complete disappearance of coins of all denominations from circulation after the Antonine period, something not observed in Africa.

    "The distribution of coins lost in Gaul, thus, is much more staggered than in Africa, for it shows a fairly steady loss rate until the middle of the second century CE, then a near total gap until the later 230s when antoniniani came to flood the markets of northern Europe, as discussed above.Another crucial issue for which the evidence from site finds is potentially helpful is the degree of monetization in the different parts of the Roman world.

    "As Reece notes, the more coins there are circulating at a given place and time, the more individual coins will be lost and not recovered.Yet, this relationship is not as simple as it may first appear.Reece himself hinted at this in an earlier publication, pointing out that a slow and steady representation of coinage produced by an excavation implies that the site enjoyed a normal, regular supply of coinage for frequent and general use.53  The idea being, in other words, that a highly functioning monetary system will produce a steady yet relatively low rate of coin loss, since the coins in such an environment would be used frequently enough that only a very few of the lowest value coins will be allowed to be lost and unrecovered. Source: An Overview of the Numismatic Evidence from Imperial Roman Africa. Daniel Hoyer. ISAW Papers 13 (2018)",
    "In a less active market environment, on the other hand, coins would be stock-pilled for a variety of purposes, such as at an army camp to be distributed to soldiers as their salary.54 Since the coins would be gathered together in a large group but actually used in market transactions less frequently, there would be less chance for individual low-value coins to be lost and scattered around a site.The most convincing idea to explain why a very large number of stray coins would be found in an excavation is that rapid debasement or a dramatic change in the monetary system suddenly makes a particular group of coins essentially valueless or demonetized, yet the intrinsic value of the coins' metal is not affected by the rising commodity prices brought on by inflation, so they are discarded in great numbers.

    "Thus, a well-functioning market economy should exhibit a coin-loss rate somewhere in between the very sparse rate expected from an under-monetized area and the great number of coins expected to be lost in staggered rates during a period of monetary instability.This is of vital importance, for it suggests that the relatively steady yet still small amount of lost coins recorded in African archaeological sites is indicative of a well-functioning and highly monetized market based on numerous and frequent transactions involving the exchange of coin.

    "This idea certainly deserves greater attention, although it is a very difficult notion to test as it relies essentially on an ex silentio argument, for it is concerned as much with the amount of coins not found as with the coins which were actually lost.Moreover, there is no threshold given for how many coins can be lost per year that indicate a well functioning monetized market before the loss rate becomes large enough to represent a different sort of market environment.

    "Still, it is an appealing idea and would seem to explain the evidence fairly well, particularly the relatively steady but low loss rates of sestertii and asses experienced in Africa, since these were the two principal denominations used in medium- and small-scale market transactions.What Does Africa's Numismatic Record Reveal About Rome's Monetary System?The preceding discussion of the contextual patterns, including site finds alongside hoarded material, points to a different mode of coin distribution and use than has traditionally been thought.

    "Indeed, numismatists and scholars of ancient monetary history typically assume that there was in all periods a strong link between state activity, particularly the needs of military personnel, and coinage.The central problem with models of Roman coinage focused only on state needs and particularly on military spending is that they leave little room for understanding how coins could have circulated without the mediation of large numbers of soldiers, yet there is an abundance of economic activity observable in many parts of the Roman world, including Africa, that seem not to involve the military at all.

    "Africa featured only one legion, the legio III Augusta, whose main camp was moved from Numidia to near Lambaesis in Mauretania Caesariensis under Hadrian to be closer to the Aures Mountain ranges, the main area of turmoil throughout the imperial period including the revolts of the 250s CE.There were also auxiliary forces, most of which were based in camps or forts in southern Numidia and Mauretania Caesariensis, although many of these military bases were constructed during the second half of the third century precisely in response to these invasions from the Aures Mountain range.55 For most of the imperial period, then, the entire region was relatively under-militarized compared with other parts of the Empire, notably northern Europe.56  Crucially, analyzing the full range of Africa's numismatic evidence together demonstrates that the majority of coins found in the region come from Numidia and Africa Proconsularis and not in the areas of the two Mauretanian provinces where much of the military manpower of the region was concentrated.

    "This latter possibility is appealing, although as Duncan-Jones notes monetized exchange should have created fairly homogeneous numismatic profiles in the different regions of the Roman Mediterranean, yet this is clearly not what the evidence reveals.58 Importantly, in both of these scenarios it is the needs of economic agents in Africa driving the distribution of coinage in the region, whether as producers of exchangeable goods or as consumers in a monetized market, rather than the needs of the Roman state.59  This idea has, in fact, been proposed in the past, although rarely with regards to the high imperial period.60 Working with the coinage uncovered by the British Excavations at Carthage, Reece notably concluded that the period of Vandal control over North Africa in the fifth and sixth centuries CE marked the first time that coins started to be minted and distributed to the region entirely to meet the demand of the general public, rather than for state needs.61 His reasoning is based on the fact that virtually all Vandal coins found in Carthage are small denomination copper, which he argues is  pointless for the state purposes of paying high officials, or overseas trade, but issource: An Overview of the Numismatic Evidence from Imperial Roman Africa.

    "It is, in fact, one of the great mysteries of Roman coin production whether the imperial minting authorities took it upon themselves to decide when and in what quantities to send low value coins to different regions, or if the call for coins came from some authority or private citizen in the province receiving them.There is actually some evidence from the eastern Empire for this latter scenario.An inscription found at Rhodiopolis in Lycia from the second century CE honors Opramoas, a private benefactor of Rhodiopolis, for having paid for bronze coins to be minted at Rome and shipped to Rhodiopolis in order to be used by the citys residents.65 This suggests that the usefulness of small change in performing market transactions was recognized by people outside of the state apparatus, and there was demand from the users of coins to remain liquid in terms of the cash supply.

    "Perhaps professional money-changers or bankers regularly 'bought' coinage from the mint in order to distribute to local consumers, charging, of course, a fee for the exchange.66  There was one major difference between the eastern and western portions of the Empire in terms of minting system, namely that civic mints throughout the East continued to mint their own bronze coins throughout the imperial period, unlike in the West where all coins were minted Rome during the second and most of third centuries CE.

    "Unfortunately, no direct evidence of a similar procedure as what Opramoas undertakes survives from anywhere in the western half of the Empire.Still, local demand for coinage is a very persuasive alternate explanation for how and why coins ended up in the Roman provinces without appealing to soldiers presence.The key question here is why the Roman state would incur the costs of producing and distributing such large quantities of so many different types of coins for such a long period?source: An Overview of the Numismatic Evidence from Imperial Roman Africa. Daniel Hoyer. ISAW Papers 13 (2018)",
    "In other words, what did the central imperial authorities get out of Romes state-controlled minting?It must be stressed here that the act of transforming metal into coined money was itself a fairly complicated, laborious, and, most importantly, expensive undertaking in any preindustrial society, particularly the ancient world.One of the main problems faced by ancient (and, for that matter, modern) minting authorities is that coins minted in low-value metals like bronze have much smaller marginal returns than silver or gold coins, since the production costsu2014mining ore, smelting, shipping the metal, melting the refined metal, shaping flans, producing dies, stamping the coins, transporting them towards the final users and tracking every step of the processu2014are roughly equivalent regardless of the metal involved. Source: An Overview of the Numismatic Evidence from Imperial Roman Africa. Daniel Hoyer. ISAW Papers 13 (2018)",
    "Yet, coins made from high-value metals provide a much greater return to the state which bears the cost of minting in terms of the buying power of the coins once minted than coins of less valuable metal.67  This seems, in fact, to be one of the reasons that scholars have long associated minting with large-scale state expenditure, as the easiest explanation for why an ancient state would bear the cost of minting coins is to assume that high-value coins were predominantly produced and that the main motivation was to cover the expenses incurred by the ruling authorities, namely paying soldiers and other dependents as well as rewarding loyal supporters and administrators. Source: An Overview of the Numismatic Evidence from Imperial Roman Africa. Daniel Hoyer. ISAW Papers 13 (2018)",
    "Surely, it is notable in this regard that the earliest coin-producing states in Asia Minor and in the Greek world concentrated on high-value metals like electrum and silver, and did not introduce low-value bronze coins until the very end of the fifth century BCE.68  It is, though, difficult to reconcile the appearance of low-value coinage with this line of reasoning.Moreover, this discussion of minting costs boils down to the idea that the real economic value of a coin to the minting authority in terms of its buying power must surpass the cost of minting that coin, otherwise the state mints at a deficit, which is unsupportable in the long term. Source: An Overview of the Numismatic Evidence from Imperial Roman Africa. Daniel Hoyer. ISAW Papers 13 (2018)",
    "Clearly, then, the higher the real value of the coin being minted, the easier it is for the minting authority to recover the costs of production; essentially, the marginal cost of coin production is inversely proportional to the value of the metal used in the coin.69 Further, there were limits to how small or light the state could make individual coins and still have them be large enough to be actually usable by people and acceptable as a legitimate currency.70 Thus, Roman bronze coins were only slightly fiduciary, meaning that the nominal, or face, value of the coins was not too far from their intrinsic value, or the value of the metal contained in the coin as a commodity.71  Significantly, the small marginal return from bronze coins which circulated at something approaching their intrinsic value as compared with the return on silver or gold coins means that bronze coins were particularly susceptible to changes in the value of the metal. Source: An Overview of the Numismatic Evidence from Imperial Roman Africa. Daniel Hoyer. ISAW Papers 13 (2018)",
    "In other words, a modest rise in the commodity price of the metals needed to produce bronze coins could push the production cost over the margin, making the cost of procuring and minting the raw material greater than the finished coins economic value.72 This may, in fact, have been one of the reasons for the abandonment of bronze denominations in favor of the billon antoninianus in the 230s CE.Given how costly it was to produce bronze coins compared to other denominations and given that silver and gold coins provided such a greater return in terms of spending power, the imperial authorities must have had some compelling reason for supporting a tri-metallic monetary system for as long as they did.

    "The desire for small-denomination currency to use in low-value, daily transactions should not be discounted as a motive for the minting authorities.This is not meant to imply any great altruistic motive the Roman state had to support the welfare of the poor.Rather, I am arguing that it was in the states own interests to keep markets stocked with official low-denomination coinage.73 This is largely because transactions will occur whether or not the state is involved, meaning that counterfeit coins are made in increasing quantities when the official coins are insufficient to meet the demands of the market.74 Large quantities of imitation coins circulating in a given area can devastate a market, causing inflationary spikes or lack of trust in the coinage due to an unregulated increase in the amount of money in the economy and driving good quality coins out of circulation. Source: An Overview of the Numismatic Evidence from Imperial Roman Africa. Daniel Hoyer. ISAW Papers 13 (2018)",
    "Further, the state had a definite interest in ensuring that its high-value currency maintained its real economic value.75 This is important, because any change in the supply or value of one metal affects the others, for there was always an official exchange rate between the different denominations.Thus, if the intrinsic value of one denomination changed, it would put stress on the nominal rate at which the coin was exchanged with other coins. Source: An Overview of the Numismatic Evidence from Imperial Roman Africa. Daniel Hoyer. ISAW Papers 13 (2018)",
    "That would exacerbate inflationary periods, since the affected coin will effectively cease to be accepted in transactions at the official tariff as its nominal exchange rate no longer mimics its intrinsic value.In order for the state to continue to receive some return on minting the silver and gold coins which it used to meet its largest financial obligations, then, the value of the bronze denominations had to remain fairly stable. Source: An Overview of the Numismatic Evidence from Imperial Roman Africa. Daniel Hoyer. ISAW Papers 13 (2018)",
    "Thus, it was absolutely crucial to keep all parts of the tri-metallic monetary system intact.76  Support for these views is given by the appearance in very large numbers of imitation coins, especially imitation antoniniani, in northern Europe during the second half of the third century at a time when the area was insufficiently stocked with bronze coins, as noted above.Perhaps the most compelling explanation for why bronze coins gradually ceased to be produced and sent to these areas is that some combination of inflation and depleting metal stocks had driven up the commodity price of copper and the other metals needed for producing bronze.

In what follows we set out this evidence —a relatively easy task despite the gaps in the record— and try to assess its significance—a much harder affair.⬈#p1\n\nThe central role of gold in late antique Egypt has been widely recognized and debated.1The vehicle of this role was the four-gramsolidusintroduced under Constantine and ubiquitous in the papyrological documentation.2But this coin was far from having an immediate impact; as was observed thirty years ago, the attestations in the papyri almost all date after 350.3There are even now just five instances known to us of mentions ofsolidiin the papyri before 350; all five are references to prices at which the coins could be purchased, none a transaction in which thesolidusis used to pay for anything.4In fact, there are even entries for purchases of a halfsolidusand two-thirds of asolidus, although these correspond to no numismatic reality at this period.

    "That half-century saw what has often been described as inflation, but was in fact, as showed inCurrency and Inflation(Bagnall1985) instead a series of steps in which the metallic value of the everyday coinage was reduced, partly by a reduction in the amount of silver in the coins and partly by a decline in the overall weight of the coins. Each such step led to a noticeable rise in prices.7Where the stated denomination of thenummusremained the same after one of these reductions, it had the effect of raising the market value of the metals in the coin in nominal terms; when thenummuswas revalued to a higher amount, that rise in market value was exaggerated.

    "Other prices followed suit. Even reforms that improved the quality of the coin could have such effects, if they involved retariffing the coin at a higher value.⬈#p4\n\nThe results can be shown in graphic form. We reproduce here two such charts fromCarlà2009: 29-30. These show the rise in the nominal price of gold bullion between 275 and 360. These charts in one sense misrepresent the phenomenon by the use of continuous lines, as if a constant rate of “inflation” was at stake, when in fact we are dealing with a step function.8But they do give a good sense of the incrementalism visible in most of the coinage reductions, as well as a sense of the exceptional place occupied by the “reform” of 325 and the Constantian revolution under discussion here.⬈#p5\n\nThe argument for this view of the price changes visible in the papyri and their relationship to the coinage has been widely accepted by both numismatists and papyrologists, although not without some controversy, at least initially; it was at the center of much of the discussion of a conference held in Rome in 1988.9It should, however, be stressed that some caution is in order in dealing with the dates of texts published after 1985, because the discussion of prices inCurrency and Inflationhas had a profound impact on the later papyrological literature, where dates have often been assigned on the basis of the chronology outlined there.

    "Does it mean it was overvalued four times at that point? The issue here is that several types of bronze or copper could command different prices. In 301, the Price Edict had listed a ‘Cyprian bronze’ or ‘copper’ at 75denariiper pound, while two forms of bronze were priced at 50 and 60denariirespectively. Values of copper and bronze obviously depended on their relative quality and whether or not the metal was in a cast or a worked form.65In fact, an implicit gold to copper commodity ratio is computable, as a goldsolidusof 1/72 of a pound is worth 730 myriads and a pound of copper is worth 18argyra– eachargyronbeing a myriad of 10,000denarii: 730 x 72 / 18 = 2,920.

    "After the adjustment was over, the AE3 would have been valued following its commodity content, preventing the state from further accruing more seignoriage while minting it. As long as billon coins retained their overvaluation, the public would have tended to hoard gold and silver coins. This may explain the restriction imposed upon the transportation of billon coins in 354, in order to force precious coins’ holders to put them back into circulation.68Currency units used by fourth-century loan contracts confirm the very marginal use of gold and silver until that period, as monetary loans from 300-363 use myriads and talents ofdenarii.69⬈#p54\n\nWhat about the exchange mechanism itself?

    "In 18thcentury France, existing coins had to be brought to the mint, where new coins were issued, but normally the new coins were not immediately provided in return – unless they were simply overstruck from existing coins with some distinctive mark when the exchange did not change the coins’ physical characteristics but simply their values in units of accounts. Coin holders were credited with a claim against the State, materialized after 1700 by interest-bearingbillets de monoyethat would later be used to obtain the new coins. Source: ISAW Papers 14.",
    "Such a delayed process ensured that the State did not have to pile up stocks of metal ahead of the recall and could recycle the metallic content of the recalled coins. However, no such mechanisms existed in Antiquity. In contrast, the frequent coin-recalls in medieval Europe led to an immediate exchange, usually at the time of major local fairs, implying the previous purchase or the availability of metallic resources.70But these demonetizations involved quite limited amounts of coinage overall. Source: ISAW Papers 14.",
    "It seems doubtful imperial mints held such large metallic supplies that they could have handled a general recoinage of a much larger scale without having hold of a proportion of the existing coinage first. Fiscal mechanisms could have helped, as the state did receive a proportion of the coins it had minted through tax payment. However, it would have taken years to achieve a substantial replacement of the coins’ supply by this sole channel, as all base coinage taxes must have represented quite a small proportion of the entire coinage supply.⬈#p55\n\nIn fact, the likely geographically sequential implementation of the reform between 351 and 354 would have decreased the need for such metallic supplies Empire-wide, while a significant proportion of coins’ holders practiced hoarding of high quality coins and further reduced the pressure on the imperial authorities.

Whatever the mechanisms might have been, the progressive disappearance of the 348 reform coinage and its replacement on or before 354 led to a significant withdrawal of silver from the base coinage pool.⬈#p56\n\nGold becomes pervasive after the 350s, probably owing to new sources of supply, as platinum content increases dramatically in the gold used by the coins of the period.71Interestingly, silver coinage is produced in copious issues in the late 350s and early 360s, compared to the 330s and 340s.72(Plate 15).

    "No analysis of silver coins produced prior to 364 was performed, but since no other coinage reform associated with a discontinuity in the pricing system occurred after the 351-353 gap, there is no reason to speculate that silver coins minted under Constantius II and Julian would not share the same metallic content with those produced under Valentinian.

    "Imposing significant losses of silver commodity on all holders of billon coins through a compulsory currency exchange becomes the most likely explanation behind such greater availability of silver, unless one would hypothesize the existence of a single cohesive source of fresh silver throughout the century.

The size of the one-shot influx, combined with a lack of sustainable sources of silver, could be correlated with the silver coinage reform initiated by Constantius II inca. 355 with a reduction in the coinage’s weight but a massive increase in minting volumes.80A sudden influx of new silver metal is highly consistent with the actual silver coinage minting activity, provided surviving coins reflect it.⬈#p60\n\nStudying fourth century coins minted in Gaul, Depeyrot ends with a very similar profile, with 2,560 silver coins minted during the 358-364 period vs. 29 only between 348 and 357 among his sample!

These and other smaller oases that punctuated the desert to the north and to the south were all connected by a network of desert routes, that linked Egypt with Libya and Sudan. During the Late Roman Period, the Western Desert oases marked the frontier of the Roman Empire; Kharga, in particular, represented an important desert crossroad, and was endowed with a scatter of forts and fortified settlements guarding its outskirts.2\n\nBetween 2001 and 2007 the northern portion of the Kharga Oasis was explored and studied by the North Kharga Oasis Survey, co-directed by the author and Ikram, that produced a first survey of all the antiquities that are currently visible in the area.

This wall composition is slightly over 50 cm thick, which is just the length of the Egyptian cubit.\n\nA careful analysis of the dimensions of the mudbricks revealed that their measures correspond to 4, 2 and 1 reformed palms respectively (figure 2), that is, to the subdivision of the Egyptian cubit of ca 52 cm into 6 parts, which was introduced during the Twenty-sixth Dynasty and superseded the older subdivision into 7 parts.10\n\nMudbricks inevitably function as basic modules, as walls and corners and therefore internal spaces are generated by their (generally regular) composition.

    "Partly as a consequence of this and partly as the result of an intentional choice, the three internal dimensions of the rooms of the Fort of Umm al-Dabadib correspond to either whole numbers of cubits, or to modular fractions of them. In addition, the use of the Egyptian cubit can be also detected in the general layout of the building’s plan, where the presence of two modules is noted, one corresponding to 5 and one to 3 cubits.11 The ruined state of the central portion of the Fort prevents, for the moment, a precise reconstruction of the dimensions of the internal courtyard.

    "However, the analysis of the available measurements suggests that these buildings, too, were planned and built using the reformed Egyptian cubit as basic unit of measurement.

    "This suggestion should be carefully tested on the field, though, or verified on reliable surveys.

    "The Epoch Dates of the Antikythera Mechanism\n(With an Appendix on its Authenticity)\nAlexander Jones, Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, New York University\nHandle: http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/ffbg7m07\n\nAbstract: Attempts previous to 2014 to date the ancient Greek astronomical Antikythera Mechanism, on the basis of the letter forms of its inscriptions or on its Egyptian Calendar scale's alignment, were inconclusive. (Occasional claims that the Mechanism was not a product of antiquity at all are refuted in an appendix to this paper.) In 2014, two separate and complex arguments were published dating the series of computed lunar and solar eclipses inscribed on the Mechanism's Saros Dial to the interval 205-187 BCE, and in 2017 an argument was presented that the Corinthian Calendar lunisolar cycle and the Panhellenic Games cycle inscribed on the Metonic and Games Dials also had an epoch in 205 BCE, four months after the eclipse epoch. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "The present paper offers a more direct confirmation of the dating of the eclipse sequence, a reaffirmation of the calendrical epoch and explanation of it in the context of Hellenistic calendar regulation and synchronization, and a hypothetical reconstruction of the design decisions that determined the choice of the two 205 BCE epochs. These decisions could plausibly have been made by a designer as late as the c. 60 BCE archeologically determined date of the shipwreck from which the Mechanism was recovered.\n\n1.

    "Introduction. The Antikythera Mechanism, a gearwork chronological-astronomical simulator whose corroded metallic (chiefly bronze) fragments were recovered from a Hellenistic shipwreck site off the island of Antikythera in 1901, is an artifact of undisputed importance for the history of Greek mechanical technology, astronomy, and calendrics.1 Since it first came to notice in 1902 in the National Archaeological Museum (Athens), there have been many attempts to date it. (For occasional allegations that it was not a product of antiquity at all, see Appendix 2.) An obvious terminus ante quem is the date of the shipwreck; and while that cannot be determined exactly, ceramics, such as transport amphorae that constituted part of the cargo and tableware that likely were the effects of the crew or passengers, point to the middle of the first century BCE, while a small hoard of 36 silver cistophoric tetradrachms minted at Pergamon and Ephesos, the portable wealth of someone on board, includes Pergamene issues ranging from approximately 104-98 BCE through approximately 76-67 BCE, but none from after the resumption of minting of these coins in 58 BCE. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "Taken collectively, the evidence of the coins and ceramics suggest a probable shipwreck date of 60 ± 10 BCE, with a date more than 20 years before or after 60 rather unlikely.2\n\nThe fragments of the Mechanism bear remains of inscribed Greek texts, ranging from single letters and words on the scales of the output dials to extended explanatory texts, using letter forms similar in general character to Hellenistic lapidary inscriptions but smaller in size, with letter height ranging from about 1.2 to about 3 mm. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "Starting within days of the 1902 \"discovery\" of the fragments, experienced epigraphers (as well as a few less qualified people) have repeatedly offered date estimates for the letter forms, but this approach has proved inconclusive; there is growing consensus among Greek epigraphers that without knowledge of the place where an inscription was made and an extensive body of dated comparanda from that place (ideally with identified individual cutters), paleographical dating has an imprecision on the order of plus or minus a century.3 Here are three recent epigraphers' verdicts on the Mechanism's inscriptions:\n\n\"… the style of writing could date the inscriptions to the second half of the 2nd century BC and the beginning of the 1st century BC, with an uncertainty of about one generation (50 years). Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "Dates around 150 BC to 100 BC are a plausible range.\" (Haralambos Kritzas)4\n\"It seems better, accordingly, to widen the palaeographical dating range for the Antikythera inscriptions to the end of the third to the beginning of the first century BC, with a preference for the earlier half of this period.\" (Charles Crowther)5\n\"… unless further securely dated examples of such tiny writing on bronze can be found, the most that can be said is that the writing dates from the end of the 3rd to the middle of the 1st century b.c.\" (Paul Iversen)6\nIn other words, so far as the letter forms go, the Mechanism could have been made any time from say 225 BCE to immediately before the shipwreck, a range that does not rule out any plausible date likely to be offered for the Mechanism on other grounds. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "Within this range, the intervals favored by individual epigraphers are liable to be influenced by the inscriptions that they use as comparanda or of which they have the most experience. Another approach is to seek datable evidence in the dials and inscribed texts—their contents now, not their paleography—or in the configuration of surviving mechanical parts in the fragments. Following earlier attempts of this kind that were received for a time as definitive but eventually proved misguided, two separate papers that appeared in 2014 deduced that one of the bodies of data inscribed on the Mechanism, a series of descriptions of possible eclipses, had been computed for dates in the interval 205 through 187 BCE.7 Each paper's argumentation follows a different methodical route, and both routes are complex and challenging to follow for a reader who is not well versed in ancient Greek and Babylonian astronomy and especially ancient eclipse theory. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "Moreover, the proposed date range is significantly earlier than the datings that had most commonly been suggested for the Mechanism (typically the second half of the second century or the first half of the first). Among the ways by which one might try to deal with this disparity are to consider whether the later datings could be mistaken, or to look for a rationale for inscribing on the Mechanism data pertaining to a period many decades, perhaps more than a century, in the past. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "But first one would like to be confident that the eclipses have indeed been correctly dated. In the present article, I first offer a more direct approach to the problem of dating the eclipse descriptions, taking advantage of certain key points in the interpretation of the evidence that are now settled so that one may assume them with passing reference to the earlier literature. Following this, I bring into consideration evidence, some derived from recent publications and some new, pertaining to other parts of the Mechanism's dials, texts, and the remains of its pointers.

    "My conclusion is that the date range of the eclipse sequence was determined by a set of chronological, astronomical, and esthetic choices that combined to constrain a somewhat artificial epoch or \"zero\" setting of the Mechanism's pointers and gearwork. The constraints could account for the selection of an epoch date quite far in the past, despite certain significant drawbacks to having a long interval between epoch setting and the present when the Mechanism was being operated.\n\n2.

The basic layout of the Antikythera Mechanism, comprising two bronze dial faces (conventionally designated \"front\" and \"back\") and, between them, a wooden casing that enclosed the complex system of gearwork driving the dial pointers, was discovered by Derek de Solla Price.8 In this preliminary section I review the evidence for the dial faces and what can be deduced from them and from the other inscriptions of the Mechanism concerning the various outputs, making minimal reference to the remains of the internal gearwork.

    "The surviving gear train would have caused the Exeligmos Dial's pointer to revolve once clockwise in three complete Saros periods as displayed on the Saros Dial, a period designated Exeligmos (ἐξελιγμός, literally \"revolution of a wheel\") in ancient Greek astronomical texts (Geminus, Introduction to the Phenomena chapter 18, and Ptolemy, Almagest Book 4, chapter 2).

    "The remaining sector seems to be vacant.18 The meaning of these numbers arises from the motivation for tripling the Saros period to make the Exeligmos: an average Saros is approximately 6585 ⅓ days, i.e. 6585 days 8 equinoctial hours, so that syzygies (and thus eclipses) in the corresponding months of successive Saros periods lag by an average of 8 equinoctial hours per cycle. If one assumes that the Saros period is an exactly constant time interval, the Exeligmos Dial indicates the number of equinoctial hours to be added to the times indicated in the Saros Dial glyphs for Saros periods succeeding the \"base\" cycle inscribed on the dial.

    "Hence each Exeligmos cycle begins when the pointer is towards the 1-o'clock position, and the (presumably) vacant sector represents the base cycle and cycles separated from it by multiples of three Saros periods, requiring zero adjustment of the times. Similar wording in BCI II.17 and 24 suggests that the latter belongs to a description of the Exeligmos Dial. The use of the singular \"tip\" (ἄκρον instead of ἄκρα) probably means that there was only this one subsidiary dial inside the Saros spiral, and for that matter a second dial circle of the same size as the Games and Exeligmos Dials, if it had existed, ought to have been partly preserved on the extant region of the plate around the Saros Dial's pointer axis.19\n\nPutting together the various kinds of information represented in the Saros and Exeligmos Dial inscriptions, we can state the Saros period relation in a form directly relating to the dials, as follows:\n\nThe front dial face (Fig. 3) was a single large circular dial inset in an approximately square plate having the same width, 17 cm, as the back face, but only about half its height (16.5 cm).

    "The Zodiac Scale also implies such a pointer, because a double alphabetic series of index letters inscribed along the dial keyed specific degrees to the Parapegma Inscription, a list of annually repeating astronomical events such as solstices, equinoxes, and appearances and disappearances of constellations that was inscribed on the plates above and below the dial. The average spacing between degree graduations on the extant part of the Zodiac Scale (extending from the middle of Virgo through the middle of Sagittarius) is significantly less than 1° (as is apparent from the fact that the sector for Libra exposed on Fragment C spans just slightly over 29 day intervals on the Egyptian Calendar Scale instead of the expected 30 ⁵/₁₂ day intervals), and this is probably deliberate: a nonuniform division of the zodiac into larger degree intervals around the solar apogee and smaller intervals around the perigee would allow a single pointer to indicate simultaneously the Egyptian calendar date and the Sun's approximate true longitude, while also making it easy to see the inequality of the astronomical seasons without operating the Mechanism, by simply counting the day graduations corresponding to the quadrants of the zodiac.21\n\nThe extant fragment, however, has the surviving portion of the Egyptian Calendar Scale in an orientation relative to the Zodiac Scale that would not have been valid for any historical date within centuries of the first century BCE, so it had apparently last been installed more or less at random.22 What looks like an engraved ra Source: ISAW Papers 17.",

    "Assuming—incorrectly—that the Egyptian Calendar Dial was fixed in position, he inferred that the version of the Egyptian calendar that it represented had to be the reformed calendar with leap-years every four years, which was instituted soon after Egypt became a Roman province in 30 BCE, and therefore that the Mechanism was made after 30 BCE.25 Although he never published his 1905-1906 research on the Mechanism, Rehm communicated this dating to Karo, who cited it in print as a basis for dating the Antikythera Wreck to after 30 BCE.26\n\nFollowing his 1958 personal examination of the fragments (by which time Fragment C was essentially as we see it now), Price recognized that the Egyptian Calendar Scale was a separate metal ring that was adjustable in its position relative to the Zodiac Scale, so that it had to pertain to the unreformed form of the calendar with constant years of 365 days.27 That observation eliminated Rehm's argument, which Price almost certainly did not know about in any case. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "On the other hand, Price was the first to take note of the supposed \"fiducial mark\" outside the Egyptian Calendar Scale, and, exploiting this, he formulated a new rationale for dating the Mechanism's manufacture. It will be worthwhile to retrace in some detail Price's reasoning, which took different forms in his 1959 popular article in Scientific American and in his final 1974 treatment in Gears From the Greeks. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "In the Scientific American article, Price provides a drawing of Fragment C that, surprisingly, lacks the inscription ΠΑΧΩΝ on the Egyptian Calendar Scale, though the two exposed letters of the following month, ΠΑ[ΥΝΙ] are shown; moreover, this was not an accidental omission since, as we will see, Price did not think that the names of the months for the exposed parts of the scale were knowable.28 This is the odder, because Price identifies the scale as referring to Egyptian months, and it is hard to see how he could have made this deduction on the basis of just the graduations (which do not span the numbers of degrees on the Zodiac Scale that one would expect for calendar days because of the nonuniform graduation of the Zodiac Scale) and just the two letters ΠΑ, but clearly he somehow did so.29 In any event, when Price asserts that the two scales, as they stand in the fragment, \"are out of phase by 13½ degrees,\" he apparently means that the arc measured counterclockwise along the Zodiac Scale from the graduation on that scale corresponding (as Price knew) to the boundary between Libra and Scorpio and the graduation on the Egyptian Calendar Scale corresponding (as we know but Price d Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "id not) to the boundary between the months Pachon and Payni was 13 ½ degree intervals.30\n\nHe continues, \"Standard tables show that this amount could only occur in the year 80 and (because we do not know the month) at all years just 120 years… before or after that date.\" This must mean that Price used modern astronomical tables to determine a year in which the Sun's longitude was at approximately Libra 16° 30' on the first day of some month of the unreformed Egyptian calendar. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "He must have found a satisfactory match for Libra 16° 30' on October 12, 80 BCE, which was the 1st of the Egyptian Phaophi (the second Egyptian month). Although, as he notes, a year 120 (solar) years earlier or later would have the Sun at the same longitude on the first of an Egyptian month (respectively Thoth, the first month, or Hathyr, the third month), he rejects these candidates on the grounds that 200 BCE is too early, and 40 CE too late, based on the archeology of the shipwreck. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "It is only at this stage of the argument that Price adduces his fiducial mark. Since \"the mark is exactly 1/2 degree away from the present position of the scale,\" by which he means that the graduation separating the two exposed month-intervals on the Egyptian Calendar Scale is half a degree counterclockwise of the mark, he infers that the scale ring had been turned by just this tiny amount since the manufacture of the Mechanism to correct for the difference between a solar year of 365 ¼ days and the Egyptian year of 365 days over two elapsed years.31 Thus the fiducial mark indicates the correct setting for 82 BCE, so that \"we are led to suggest that the instrument was made about 82 , used for two years… and then taken onto the ship within the next 30 years.\" (This last item was to accommodate Gladys Weinberg's information that the wreck date was estimated as 65 ± 15 BCE.)32\n\nThree remarks can be made concerning Price's 1959 argument. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "First, it only works because Price treated the identities of the Egyptian months to which the exposed parts of the Egyptian Calendar Dial belonged as unknowns. Leaving aside the complete month name ΠΑΧΩΝ that he entirely failed to notice, the initial letters ΠΑ of the following month, which he did record, would, if recognized as a month name (hence either Pachon or Payni), have ruled out any date within the 200 BCE to 40 CE span that, he supposes, exceeds in both directions the archeologically acceptable interval. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "Second, the claimed precision of a single year for the scale alignment is spurious. Without knowledge of the solar theory underlying the Mechanism's Sun/date pointer and the time of day to which the alignment is supposed to apply, the intended date for any alignment would easily be subject to an uncertainty of a decade or more. Thirdly, Price assumes that the scale alignment indicated by a fiducial mark must apply to a date contemporary with the Mechanism's manufacture; he does not consider the possibility that, as was common with astronomical tables, an epoch date in the past might have been chosen. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "In the 1974 version, Price uses a slightly different datum to determine the date of last setting of the Mechanism, namely that, by his reckoning, in Fragment C as it stands Libra 0° is aligned with the 13-and-a halfth day of an Egyptian month. Instead of using modern tables, he now interpolates between autumnal equinox observations reported in Ptolemy's Almagest (Book 3 chapter 1) for 147 BCE (Hipparchus) and 139 CE (Ptolemy), finding that \"In 87 it was therefore at the 13th Thoth and two years later, in 85 it was at the 13½ Thoth.\"33 Again there is a misleading air of precision about these calculations, since not only does Price disregard the times of day or night reported for the Hipparchian and Ptolemaic equinoxes but he assumes that Ptolemy's equinox dates are a reliable guide to the equinox dates that would have been assumed by the makers of the Mechanism, even though the date and time given for the 139 CE equinox are notoriously more than a day too late. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "But the more serious problem for Price is that he now was aware of the ΠΑΧΩΝ inscription, whereas his computation had determined that, for a setting appropriate for 85 BCE, the month in that location of the scale ought to have been Thoth. His attempt to resolve this conflict is confused. Taking the alignment of Libra 0° and Thoth 13 in 87 BCE as a kind of given, he calculates that an alignment of Libra 0° with Pachon 13 would correspond to approximately 876 CE or 586 BCE, \"both of which are beyond the range of archaeological possibility.\" True enough. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "But what is this calculation supposed to mean in terms of the epoch and final setting of the Mechanism? In the end, he decides that the fiducial mark indicates that \"the instrument was engraved ca 87 or at some other date distant from that by a multiple of 120 years, 34 , 154 , etc.\"—though of course these later dates should have been out of the question. Or if we wish to push the date backward from 87, Price thinks that we have to go back not 120 years but 143 years to 230 BCE, to take into account that the five epagomenal days fall between Thoth and the preceding calendar month, Mesore.34 This would only make sense, however, if the idea was that the Egyptian Calendar Ring was supposed to be aligned at epoch with reference to the Libra 0° mark—in which case what was the point of having a separate fiducial mark? Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "In fact the whole discussion of the dating is irredeemably muddled, giving the impression that Price wanted simultaneously to hold on to the idea that his fiducial mark indicated an epoch setting for the Egyptian Calendar Dial, to the idea that this epoch was only a few years before the shipwreck date, and to the idea that the shipwreck date was represented by the present alignment of the Egyptian Calendar Ring, in the face of the contrary evidence from the inscribed month names.\n\nA symptom of Price's muddle is that he never clearly sets out how the fiducial mark was supposed to be used. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "The principle, one would think, would be that, for some chosen \"zero\" setting, this mark should line up with the beginning of the Egyptian calendar year, that is, with the graduation on the Egyptian Calendar Scale separating the sectors for the epagomenal days and for Thoth. Never mind how the calendar ring is aligned in the existing Fragment C, which is probably just a random configuration thoughtlessly created by whoever packed the Mechanism up for its fateful voyage.

    "The alignment that matters is the fixed one noted above in section 2 between the mark and, approximately, Libra 18° on the Zodiac Scale. In what years was the Sun within, say, 2° of Libra 18° at, say, noon (for the meridian of Rhodes) on Thoth 1? Using modern theory for the solar longitudes, this criterion is satisfied from 217 through 202 BCE.

In reality, however, the Saros period relation has inaccuracies in every element, some of them pronounced:\n\n(4)    223 synodic months\n\n                 ≈ 238.992 anomalistic months\n\n                 ≈ 241.999 dracontic months\n\n                 ≈ 18.03 years\n\n                 ≈ 6585.322 days\n\nThe inaccuracies result in slow long-term changes in the distribution of EPs in repeating Saros cycles, and more rapid changes in the syzygy times.

    "This raises the prospect that we may be able to determine a specific interval of 223 months for which the data inscribed on the Mechanism were computed, if the computations were based on a reasonably good theory and if enough data survive. The 2014 papers by Christián Carman and James Evans and by Tony Freeth separately arrived at such a dating, concluding that the opposition in the first month (i.e. the first syzygy) of the cycle was that of May 12, 205 BCE, and hence that the base Saros cycle was bounded by the conjunctions of April 28, 205 BCE and May 9, 187 BCE.

    "We will now see that this dating can be obtained by a comparatively simple argument. The astronomical information contained in the Saros Dial scale inscriptions can be reduced to four knowns:\n\n(i) We know, probably within a degree or two, the assumed elongation of the mean Moon (or equivalently, the mean Sun) from the Moon's ascending node at each mean syzygy of the cycle that is implied by the distribution of EPs. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "The essential elements in this deduction are the following:\n\nThe lunar EPs were the complete set of 38 oppositions in the Saros for which the mean Moon at mean opposition was calculated as closer to a node than at the preceding and following oppositions.38 Equivalently, one can generate the sequence as the set of mean oppositions for which the lunar latitude, neglecting lunar anomaly, falls within a range of values centered on the ecliptic and just broad enough so that one and only one EP occurs near the date when the Sun passes one of the nodes. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "The cycle can be shown to have comprised five groups of seven or eight lunar EPs at six-month intervals, with a five-month interval separating each group from the next, following an 8-7-8-7-8 pattern, starting with cell 37.39 (The numbered cells in Fig. 1 illustrates this alignment.) To obtain this pattern, the assumed elongation of the mean Moon from the nearest node at the mean opposition of the cycle's first month should have been approximately –37.3° ± 0.3°.40\nThe solar EPs were a set of 28 conjunctions, each of which was one of the two consecutive conjunctions immediately preceding and following a lunar EP.41 The fact that several lunar EPs were not neighbored by solar EPs is a consequence of a modelling assumption that a conjunction is a solar EP if and only if the lunar latitude at mean conjunction, neglecting lunar anomaly, falls within a range of values that is narrower than the latitudinal range for lunar EPs, with the positive limiting value further from the ecliptic than the negative limiting value. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "This asymmetry was clearly intended to take account of the influence of parallax on the Moon's apparent latitude for an observer in the Mediterranean region.42 The pattern of solar EPs implies that the mean Moon was assumed to be at an elongation of approximately –39.6° ± 0.2° from the ascending node at the mean opposition of month 1. The disjunction of about 2° between this result and the result obtained from the lunar EP pattern probably tells us that the two sets of EPs were derived from distinct eclipse theories that may have had slightly different alignments for the lunar nodes.

    "For our analysis, we assume that the nodal elongation for the mean opposition of month 1 was –38° ± 5°, surely an overgenerous tolerance.\n(ii) We know that the Moon was assumed to be at its apogee at the opposition of month 1, from the following considerations:\n\nThe times recorded for the EPs on the Saros Dial scale have to be understood as times of true syzygy expressed in \"idealized\" hours of day or night, that is, equinoctial hours counted from 6 AM for day and 6 PM for night.

    "This sinusoidal component turns out to be aligned such that the opposition of month 1—the first syzygy of the Saros cycle—has the Moon approximately at apogee.44\nAs noted above in section 2, the inside of the Saros Dial scale was engraved with an extant graduation at the 3-o'clock position, and by inference also with graduations at the 12-o-clock, 6-o'clock, and 9-o'clock positions, indicating alignments where the Moon would be at its apogee at opposition.45 These marks reflect the roughly 14-month beat cycle of the anomalistic month relative to the synodic month.

    "This shows that the anomalistic alignment deducible from the recorded EP times was intentional and built into their method of computation. (An intentional anomalistic alignment for the first month of the Saros also explains the otherwise puzzling decision to begin the cycle with a month not containing an EP.)46 Since the Moon's apsidal line was more difficult to determine precisely in antiquity than than the nodal line, we should grant a larger tolerance for this datum; allowance for a misalignment of as much as a day's worth of lunar motion, say ±15°, should be more than sufficient.\n(iii) A component dependent on solar anomaly can also be isolated from the differences between recorded true and computed mean syzygy times, though its alignment is less precisely determined.47 One of the previous studies estimated that the Sun's implied elongation from apogee at the opposition of month 1 was between –30° and 0°.48 There is no evidence on the Mechanism comparable to the graduation marks of the Saros Dial to suggest that the solar anomaly was assumed to be aligned in a special way.\n\n(iv) Aside from the periodic components discussed above, the recorded times also yield information about the alignment of the mean Moon relative to the mean Sun; in effect, for the correct date the errors in the recorded times compared to times Source: ISAW Papers 17.",

    "As a search range, we initially take the two centuries from 250 BCE to 50 BCE. The latter end of this interval is set by the estimated date of the Antikythera shipwreck, 60 ± 10 BCE as stated above, section 1. The earlier end is admittedly arbitrary. Candidate datings become increasingly implausible the further back one goes from the period within which the manufacture of the Mechanism is imaginable, because, while for some purposes one may have wanted an epoch date in the moderately remote past, an interval equivalent to thousands of revolutions of the input knob would have been impractical—in this respect, a mechanism is more limited than a set of astronomical tables. (On the other hand, we should not be overconservative, since a device supplied with dials representing cycles as long as 76 and 54 years—roughly equivalent to 350 and 250 turns of the input knob—was evidently meant to display dates spanning intervals at least that long.) Two centuries of data suffice to show the pattern of data points that arises over time with respect to the Moon's elongations from the apogee and from the ascending node, and we are free to extrapolate the date range further if the pattern suggests that there may be candidate dates beyond the provisional limits.

The resulting anomaly-latitude elongation pairs, plotted in Fig. 5, are not scattered evenly but form a lattice of little slanting rows of tightly spaced data points, reflecting the fact that the Saros period brings about an approximate but not an exact return of the Moon to the same situations in anomaly and latitude.

To cut to the chase: the middle point, corresponding to the opposition of May 12, 205 BCE, turns out to be the one we want. The Almagest theory value for the elongation of the mean Moon from apogee at mean syzygy is –7° 8', that for the mean Moon's elongation from the ascending node –40° 3', and that for the mean Sun's elongation from its apogee –18° 25'.

Before we turn from the Mechanism's eclipse sequence epoch to the epochs of the calendrical displays, it will be worth our while to consider how effective a predictor of eclipses the Mechanism would have been if its predictions were compared with accurate observations.

    "To start with, let us imagine an idealized version of the Saros Dial on which are recorded astronomically accurate times of true syzygies for 205 through 187 BCE to a precision of a minute instead of an hour. Thus in Table 1, we give in the leftmost columns the computed UT modern-theory dates times of opposition for all 38 lunar EPs from this interval, and in subsequent columns we give the times for the corresponding lunar EPs in the subsequent three Saros periods accompanied by the errors (prediction minus true) of the opposition times that would have been predicted by applying the time correction from the Exeligmos Dial to the times in the second column.54 With each progressive Saros, the mean error increases by about a quarter-hour (respectively +0.24, +0.49, and +0.73 hours), while the standard deviation increases by about two-thirds of an hour (respectively 0.67, 1.35, and 2.02). Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "After one exeligmos, errors of more than four hours are frequent. The worsening unreliability of the predicted times is, of course, a consequence of the inaccuracies of the Saros relation we pointed out at the beginning of this section. But the Mechanism's eclipse prediction function is not really a case of good predictions of times of mid eclipse for the epoch Saros cycle, decent ones for the neighboring ones, and progressively poor ones for more remote cycles. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "The time predictions for the epoch cycle, as we have seen, were themselves quite poorly computed, with standard deviation approaching two hours and several individual errors approaching three hours, even when the handful of grossly discrepant times are excluded. The inaccuracy would have been compounded by additional errors of comparable magnitude if the times, expressed as they are as hours of day or night though actually equinoctial hours counted from 6 hours before and after noon, were confronted with observed times in genuine seasonal hours counted from sunrise and sunset. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "The situation was even worse with respect to predicted times for solar eclipses, since parallax can cause the observable time of mid eclipse to differ from the time of true conjunction by as much as two hours. Moreover, the descriptions of solar eclipses in the Back Plate Inscription, which are supposed to apply to groups of all solar EPs in the Saros period that have approximately the same lunar latitude, provide us with a broader range of predicted characteristics of eclipses that would inevitably have compared badly with observations, including statements of disk color, magnitude, and (likely) changing wind directions.55 It seems clear, therefore, that the Mechanism's eclipse predictions were not devised in a context of operation in which its predictions were likely to be tested or verified against observations.56\n\n5.

    "Corinthian Calendar years, like all lunisolar calendar years, are variable in length and never equal to a solar year, whereas equal quadrants swept over by a uniformly moving pointer would effectively represent solar years, beginning and ending on fixed dates according to the solar year, not according to a lunisolar calendar year. Hence the Games Dial pointer would not normally cross from one quadrant to the next at exactly the same time as the Metonic Dial's pointer crosses from one calendar year to the next, though the margin of discrepancy would always be within one lunar month.

    "The roughly 7–8° counterclockwise twist of the quadrant divisions from horizontal and vertical is likely to have its explanation in the conflict between the two kinds of year. The angle closely corresponds to one lunar month's motion of the pointer, so that if one imagines a second set of quadrant divisions in the precise horizontal and vertical orientations, the small segments between each pair of nearby divisions could bound the interval within which the actual calendar year always began.

    "If, however, the inscribed festivals all were held in the last part of the calendar year, there would only be call for inscribing the divisions representing the latest possible pointer position for the change of calendar year to prevent the pointer from ever indicating festivals belonging to the wrong year.62 If this is correct, the pointer should have been oriented exactly vertically or horizontally at the beginning of the 19-year calendar cycle since the calendar cycle was in the standard norm.

    "Thus at the beginning of Year 1 of each 19-year calendar cycle, the Metonic Dial pointer was oriented straight down, and at the beginning of Year 1 of each 4-year athletic festival cycle, the Games Dial pointer was oriented either straight down or within a few degrees of straight down. Iversen has proposed that the configuration in which both pointers were simultaneously oriented straight down corresponded to a deliberately chosen epoch for the dials of the Mechanism's upper back face.63 Moreover, since this configuration would recur every 4×19 = 76 years, the lost Callippic Dial could also have been inscribed so that its pointer would be oriented downwards, marking the beginning of the first 19-year period of the full 76-year cycle, whenever the other two pointers were in their epoch orientation.

    "As a step toward determining what year was chosen for this epoch, Iversen hypothesizes that the quadrant dividers of the Games Dial did not represent an abstract latest possible position for the beginning of the Corinthian Calendar year relative to the solar year, but specifically the annual occurrence of an observable astronomical phenomenon that was required to fall within the last month of the calendar year.

    "An epoch year would then have been a Corinthian Calendar year whose end overlapped with an Olympiad Year 1 and whose first month had the earliest possible position relative to the critical astronomical phenomenon.

    "Iversen offers as the most plausible candidates for an astronomical phenomenon that was always kept within the calendar year's last month the heliacal rising of Arcturus and the autumnal equinox. He further proposes that the calendar epoch year was the one that began in 205 BCE, immediately following the May 12, 205 BCE eclipse epoch. The conjunction marking this epoch year-beginning would have been that of August 23, 205 BCE. (Whether the actual epoch coincided with this date or fell one or two days later would depend on how the mean beginning of the lunar month was defined in relation to the conjunction or the following first visibility of the Moon.) The Corinthian calendar year 205/204 BCE would have been a year 1 according to the scheme of the Games Dial, since 204/203 BCE was Year 1 of the 144th Olympiad. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "Two further considerations confirm that the calendar epoch was indeed the fourth month counting from the lunar month containing the eclipse epoch. Firstly, we consider the appearance of the entire back face when the Mechanism would have been set to the calendrical epoch. Because the Exeligmos Dial is divided into its three time-correction sectors such that the beginning of its cycle is at the 1-o'clock orientation, its pointer and the pointer of the Saros Dial would have been nearly parallel at the calendrical epoch. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "Given that the orientation chosen for the Exeligmos Dial's sector divisors is so nonintuitive and otherwise unexplained, it seems clear that an intentional element in the design of the back face was that both the upper dial pointers taken as a group and the lower dial pointers taken as a group should be in parallel orientations, and that the Exeligmos Dial's division was normed so as to have this effect.64\n\nSecondly, Christián Carman has shown that the location of the Metonic Dial pointer along the spiral slot, preserved in Fragment B, and the orientation of the Exeligmos Dial pointer, preserved in Fragment A, correspond with a high degree of probability to a date approximately 143 lunar months later than a date for which the back dial pointers all had the parallel configuration described above.65 In other words, when the Mechanism was lost in the shipwreck, its gearwork was set to a date less than 12 years after an epoch setting as hypothesized by Iversen. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "Such a brief interval is unlikely to be an accident; rather, it argues strongly that the Mechanism had recently been set or reset to this epoch configuration. As we have seen, Iversen hypothesizes that the Corinthian calendar year was defined by a principle that either the autumnal equinox or (he thinks less likely) the morning rising of Arcturus was always within the first month of the year.

    "In that case, the equinox is quite early in the month in 205 BCE; but this makes a problem since the calendrical epoch year should be one in which the first calendar month is in its earliest possible position, so the equinox should be close to the end of the month. If, on the other hand, we suppose that the rising of Arcturus was supposed to fall within the first month, this could work for 205 BCE, if we use Arcturus's rising as estimated by modern theory.

    "However, there is an indication inscribed on the Zodiac Scale at a location corresponding to a date approximately 10 days before the autumnal equinox that probably refers to the rising of Arcturus, and if we use this date, it is no longer close enough to the end of the lunar month in 205 BCE for the month to be in its earliest possible position. The near coincidence of the summer solstice and the conjunction and new Moon crescent in 205 BCE suggests another, perhaps more satisfactory hypothesis for how the Corinthian year could have been defined, namely not as beginning with the month within which some astronomical event fell, but as beginning with the third month following the summer solstice.

    "This definition, taken together with the assumption that intercalation was consistently performed by a repetition of calendar month IV, would in principle have fully synchronized the Corinthian calendar to the Athenian calendar, whose year began with the first month after the solstice.

    "Our evidence for ancient Greek calendars, including such fundamental matters as the names and order of the months and the season when the calendar year began for any particular calendar, and the procedures for deciding when a month or a year began and how long it should be, derives largely from inscriptions preserving actual dates, and in many instances is very incomplete. The calendar of Athens, being exceptionally well documented, has played a normative role among Greek calendars in both ancient chronography and modern scholarship, and its operation and regulation have been investigated—and disputed—more extensively than any of the others. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "It will be helpful here to summarize certain aspects, primarily concerning the evidence for intercalation practices, as they are currently understood. The Athenian calendar year began in early summer—we will refine this presently, but for now we just assume the undisputed principle that the year normally began in June or July (Julian). The twelve months and their sequence are given in Table 7. The normal month to be repeated in intercalary years was VI.67\n\nAn idealized form of the Athenian calendar created for astronomical applications is the Callippic calendar, which is attested in Ptolemy's Almagest and in a few Demotic and Greek astronomical papyri.68 The distinguishing feature of dates expressed in the Callippic calendar is that the calendar years were numbered serially within serially numbered 76-year \"periods\" (περίοδοι), such that Period 1 Year 1 was 330/329 BCE. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "As is obvious from this structure, the pattern of intercalary years in the Callippic calendar followed a 19-year cycle. From attested dates in Periods 1 and 6 associated with absolutely datable astronomical observations or predictions, it can be deduced that each 76-year period comprised four well-distributed 19-year cycles following the standard norm, such that the beginning of the first month of each cycle was almost immediately after the summer solstice, a rule set out by Plato, Laws 767C, for the calendar of an ideal state, and generally assumed to have applied to the calendar of Athens, though apparently nowhere explicitly prescribed for it in sources available to us. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "The fact that the Callippic periods are of 76 rather than just 19 years tells us that the calendar also regulated the distribution of 30-day and 29-day months, perhaps according to an arithmetical scheme such as that of the Mechanism's Metonic Dial or a similar scheme described by Geminus, Introduction to the Phenomena chapter 8. The beginning of the month was, on average, closer to the conjunction than to the date of first visibility of the new Moon crescent. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "Our knowledge of the intercalations of the actual calendar of Athens is chiefly dependent on inscriptions from which the character of specific years as intercalary or ordinary can be deduced. Athenian years were not numbered, but were identified by the name of the magistrate called the \"archon eponymous\" and by the secretary of the boule who held office during the year. In isolation, an archon name yields no information about the Julian equivalent of an Athenian year, but since the selection of secretaries normally cycled through the Attic tribes, an otherwise roughly dated year that is designated by a secretary or by an archon associated with a known secretary can often be dated exactly. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "For some intervals of the Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman periods the archon lists are fully known—in particular, the History of Diodorus Siculus provides a sequence of Athenian archons correlated with Olympiad years from 480/479 through 308/307 BCE—but other intervals are subject to gaps and uncertainties. An inscription containing an isolated date with an identifiable year and a month specified as intercalary (δεύτερος, \"second,\" or ἐμβόλιμος, \"intercalary\") naturally establishes that year as intercalary, but such documents are rather infrequent, and moreover provide no positive evidence for years that were ordinary. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "Fortunately there are some types of inscription from which the characters of a larger number of years, both intercalary and ordinary, can be obtained. From around 340 BCE on, dates are commonly expressed both according to the calendar month and day and by the day number of the term of the prytany currently held by one of the Attic tribes. Since these terms were approximately equal, being the length of the calendar year divided by the number of tribes, the correlations make it possible to determine whether the year had twelve or thirteen months.

    "From the Roman period, we have lists of gymnasiarchs serving typically for terms of one month, from which we sometimes have a sequence of attested months around month VI that either include or definitely do not include an intercalary VI.

    "In principle an identical pattern would result either from relying directly on an assumed 19-year cycle or (since the equation of 19 tropical years with 235 lunar months is quite accurate) from observing or forecasting the summer solstice. The two methods should not be thought of as exclusive of each other, as can be seen from two testimonia regarding Meton of Athens: on the one hand Diodorus, Bibliotheca Historica 12.36.2 states that Skirophorion 13 in the archon year of Apseudes (433/432 BCE) was the \"starting point\" (ἀρχή) of Meton's 19-year cycle (ἐννεακαιδεκαετηρίς), while a scholion to Aristophanes, Birds 997 (FGrH 328 F 122) states that in the archon year of Apseudes Meton erected a \"sun-turning-thing\" (ἡλιοτρόπιον), presumably an instrument by which the date of solstice could be determined, against the wall of the Pnyx.

    "Skirophorion 13 was in fact the summer solstice date in 432 BCE associated with Meton by IMilet inv. 84 + inv. 1604 and by Ptolemy, Almagest 3.1.74 An intercalation cycle would have enabled the character of a year to be determined in advance (a necessity when the intercalated month was not the final one), while reference to observed solstices would have provided a check of the cycle's alignment with the seasons.\n\nA convenient way to model the intercalations of a well-distributed calendar cycle regulated by the rule that an annual phenomenon (such as summer solstice) must always be within the final month of the year is to treat that month as nominally a 30-day month, and calculate the day number dn of the phenomenon within the last month of Year n thus:\n\n(5)    dn = dn–1 + 11 ¹/₁₉ days mod 30\n\nWhenever the addition of 11 ¹/₁₉ would result in a value exceeding 30, Year n needs an extra month to keep the phenomenon within it, and thus is intercalary.

    "After the beginning of the first century BCE the inscriptional evidence for intercalary and ordinary years dries up for more than two centuries. Was the same \"Callippic\" well-distributed pattern of intercalations by 19-year cycles continued? If so, the earliest year-beginning of the cycles would gradually have drifted sufficiently later than the summer solstice (Fig. 10), so that year 12 of the cycle, an ordinary year, would begin more than a month after the solstice, because 235 mean lunar months is about ¹/₁₁ days longer than 19 tropical years.

    "Simone Follet determined from inscriptions the characters of eleven Athenian years spread over most of the second century CE (Table 9).76 All are consistent with the Callippic intercalation cycle, with one exception: 138/139 CE, which, being an ordinary Year 12 according to the Callippic norm, Follet deduced to have been intercalary; there are no other definite attestations from Years 11 and 12.77 Since an exchange of character of Callippic norm Years 11 and 12 is precisely what would have resulted from a renorming of the intercalation cycle to take account of the backward creep of the solstice relative to the lunations, it appears credible, even likely, that such a renorming had taken place by the early second century CE. A terminus post quem for such a renorming is 168/167 BCE, a Year 11 according to the Callippic norm that is known to have been intercalary.78 One might tentatively date a renorming, if it did indeed happen, to the late second or first century BCE, when the gap between the solstice and the beginning of the first month of Callippic norm Year 1s would have become large enough to motivate it.

    "For our present purposes, calendar synchronization will mean the existence of rules regulating two lunisolar calendars such that any Month m of one calendar always, or almost always, coincides with Month n in the other calendar where n–m is constant; the calendar years need not coincide. If A and B are two well-distributed lunisolar calendars, their years will remain in rough alignment without systematic drift, that is, for any month of calendar A, there will be at most two consecutive months of calendar B that can coincide with that month.79 Whenever an intercalary month is inserted in calendar A, the ensuing months of A will have counterparts one month earlier in B than in the previous year, with a return to the previous alignment when B has its next intercalation. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "For every month in calendar A to have only one counterpart in calendar B and vice versa, the intercalations in both calendars must therefore be simultaneous, not just to the year but to the month. Such synchronizations would not be likely to occur by accident, but one might look for evidence of them as a deliberate means of facilitating communication, travel, and commerce between Greek cities.\n\nA particularly rich source of such evidence is the corpus of well over a thousand manumission inscriptions from Delphi.80 These inscriptions, recording the sales of slaves to the god Apollo that effected their emancipation, mostly date from the last two centuries BCE and the first century CE, and in many a date is preserved expressed in both the calendar of Delphi and the calendar of the city where the owner resided.

    "When we have sufficient such double dates correlating the Delphian month with the calendar of a particular other locality, as many as three tests of synchronization may be possible: (1) consistent correspondence of individual months of the other calendar with just one month of the calendar of Delphi, (2) consistent correspondence of individual months of the calendar of Delphi with just one month of the other calendar, and (3) correspondence of intercalary months of the two calendars.

    "In Phokis, the region immediately surrounding Delphi, two systems for designating months were in use, namely a set—or perhaps multiple sets for different Phokian cities—of month names (Amalios, Dionysios, etc.), and ordinal numbering (πρῶτος = \"first,\" δεύτερος = \"second,\" etc.) counting from the first month of the calendar year. In the manumission inscriptions the ordinal naming is more frequent, and for our calendrical purposes it is more useful since it directly locates a Phokian month as well as whatever Delphian month is equated with it in the annual sequence—in fact, Kirchhoff's reconstruction of the order of months of the calendar of Delphi was based on the Phokian equations.81 Table 10 lists inscriptions correlating the Phokian numbered months with months of the Delphian calendar.

Moreover, while we have no instance of an intercalary Phokian month using the ordinal naming, FD III 1:333 equates a named Phokian intercalary month (Amalios) with the Delphian intercalary month (Poitropios), satisfying test (3).

    "Thus we have strong evidence that the calendars of Delphi and Phokis were synchronized, which also implies that both were regulated according to some cyclic principle.

    "Although we lack a direct equation of intercalary months, IG IX,12 3:672 attests to an Aitolian intercalary month IV, which would correspond to a Delphian intercalary month VI if intercalations took place in the same year. Hence the evidence for synchronization with the calendar of Delphi is also good for Ozolian Lokris and compelling for Aitolia. The Delphian calendar years 176/175, 168/167, 154/153, 143/142, and 140/139 BCE are known to have been intercalary, and the same has been proposed with less certitude for 165/164, 163/162, and 130/129.82 All these years except the doubtful 163/162 were intercalary in the Athenian calendar according to the Callippic norm.

    "Moreover, the comparatively scarce attested equations of Delphian and Athenian months (FD III 2:66 equates Delphian III and Athenian III, and SGDI II 2089 equates Delphian VI and Athenian VI) are consistent with their calendar years' beginning concurrently, so that also their intercalary months would have been simultaneous. Hence we have a group of calendars of central Greece that were synchronized with the Athenian calendar during the late Hellenistic period. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "How widespread such synchronization was in this time is impossible to say. In the preceding section we saw that the calendrical epoch of the Antikythera Mechanism is likely to have been determined by the assumption that month I of the Corinthian calendar year was the third month beginning after the summer solstice, and moreover the repeated month in all intercalary years was likely to have been IV.

    "Since in the Athenian calendar month I was the first beginning after the solstice and month VI was the intercalated month, the Corinthian calendar as inscribed on the Mechanism was in principle synchronized with the Athenian calendar—\"in principle,\" because complete synchronization would be contingent on a presumed renorming of the Athenian 19-year cycle (so that the years that were formerly Year 12 became Year 1) for which the evidence is slight, and \"as inscribed on the Mechanism,\" because we cannot know the exact extent to which the structuring of the Corinthian calendar on the Mechanism reflects actual calendrical practices in any locality where it was in use.

Rationale for the epoch dates and significance for the Mechanism. One way to approach a clearer understanding of how the makers of the Mechanism came to choose its epoch dates is to consider them as part of a broader process of designing a device for simulating a multiplicity of chronological and astronomical functions—admittedly a speculative exercise, but not hopelessly so, given that so much of what we know about the Mechanism has obvious connections with other products of Hellenistic astronomy. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "For this purpose, we can think of the Mechanism as comprising three conceptually separable divisions: one to synchronize the natural solar-stellar year, the lunisolar calendar, and the phases and zodiacal revolutions of the Moon, a second to predict eclipses and introduce an anomalistic component in the Moon's revolutions, and a third to incorporate the revolutions and synodic anomalies of the five planets. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "We will be concerned here only with the first two.\n\nI suggest that the germ of the Mechanism was the idea of coordinating the two kinds of time reckoning that were central concerns of Greek astronomy already in the fifth century BCE, if later testimony can be relied on: the lunisolar calendrical structures that pertained to the religious, administrative, and civil life of the Greek cities, and the \"parapegmatic\" years defined and subdivided by solstices, equinoxes, and the rising and setting dates of stars and constellations and associated with natural phenomena such as seasonal weather patterns.

    "Surviving Hellenistic parapegmata such as the second century BCE inscription fragment IMilet inv. 456B and the complete parapegma transmitted as an appendage to Geminus's Introduction to the Phenomena divide the natural year into twelve segments of varying duration corresponding to the intervals during which the Sun traverses the twelve zodiacal signs, with the solstices and equinoxes set on the first days of the segments belonging to Cancer, Libra, Capricorn, and Aries. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "Accordingly, an initial design decision for an Ur-Mechanism was to represent the natural year by a pointer whose axis, driven more or less directly by the input rotation, revolved around a circular Zodiac Scale divided into twelve zodiacal sectors. Index letters at the beginning of each sector would mark the solstices, equinoxes, and entries of the Sun into each zodiacal sign, and other index letters irregularly spaced along the sectors would mark the dates of stellar phenomena. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "Instead, however, of subdividing the sectors into the individual number of days of the Sun's travel through each sign as in other parapegmata, the designer chose to make the scale primarily a spatial rather than a temporal one by inscribing thirty degree-divisions in each sector, anticipating that the scale would serve to track the revolutions of other heavenly bodies, not just the Sun. This use of degrees of longitude can be seen as an intrusion into the parapegma tradition from the later Hellenistic engagement with Babylonian mathematical astronomy.83\n\nBut the designer also wished to represent the time-dimension of the parapegmata, that is, the unequal numbers of days assigned to the zodiacal signs, a concept that allegedly can also be traced back to the fifth century in the form of an assumption that the astronomical seasons delimited by the solstices and equinoxes are unequal in length. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "This might have been accomplished by providing a second zodiac scale concentric with the spatial one but such that the sectors were subdivided into the requisite number of day-divisions. Instead, the designer adopted the 365-day Egyptian calendar year as a time scale, perhaps because the Egyptian \"wandering year\" was a familiar topic in the Greek astronomical and chronographical literature as we know from Geminus, Introduction to the Phenomena chapter 8. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "This choice had two corollaries: first, that the Egyptian Calendar Scale had to be a separate component installable in any alignment with the zodiac scale, since the Egyptian calendar dates of the annual solar and stellar phenomena were not constants but shifted forward by one day every four years; and secondly, because of this variable alignment of the temporal scale with the spatial scale, the inequality of the numbers of days in which the Sun traverses the zodiacal signs had to be represented by nonuniform spacing of the signs and degrees on the Zodiac Scale, not by nonuniform spacing of the months and days on the Egyptian Calendar Scale.

    "While it may have been considered desirable to have a reference mark indicating the alignment of the Egyptian Calendar Scale with the Zodiac Scale for some epoch year to facilitate determining the correct alignment for other years, nothing in the structure of this dial favored any particular epoch year over any other.

    "Turning to the lunisolar calendar display, it would have been mechanically possible to devise a gear train leading from the axis that bears the solar pointer to another output axis whose revolution represents a 19-year, 235-month calendrical period; but such a dial, giving less than 2° to each lunar month, would not have been an effective means of showing the details of the calendrical cycle.

    "By contrast, the subsidiary dials for the 4-year games cycle and the 76-year supercalendrical cycle were straightforward both in concept and gearwork. On the Mechanism that we have the luck to possess as a consequence of the Antikythera Shipwreck, the Metonic Dial is inscribed with the months and years of the Corinthian calendar, but this was probably a modification of the calendar display that appeared on the prototype mechanism, to suit an intended owner living in a locality where the Corinthian calendar was in use.

    "What calendar was on the prototype we can only guess, but in the light of the fact that the Rhodian Halieia is among the athletic festivals inscribed around the Mechanism's Games Dial, Iversen's proposal of the calendar of Rhodes is highly plausible.84 The cycle as described on the prototype dial scale might have been an accurate representation of the way the Rhodian calendar was regulated at the time of the Mechanism's manufacture, or in some respects an idealized or prescriptive version influenced by ideas of how a calendar should be regulated.

    "Nor would the addition of a uniformly-revolving lunar longitude output to what started as the solar longitude-parapegma dial, or the provision of a lunar phase display, affect the epoch situation, because the 19-year period is assumed to comprise an exact integer number of synodic months and zodiacal revolutions of the Moon. 76 years' worth of rotary input forward or backward in time would return every single gear and pointer to precisely its initial position.

    "Interestingly, with the calendrical dials calibrated to fit the Rhodian calendar year, the solar and lunar pointers would be close to alignment (conjunction) in the approximate direction of the beginning of Libra—at the bottom point of the Zodiac Scale in our Mechanism—at each 76-year epoch. This is a feature that would have been lost in a conversion to a different calendar. Incorporating a cyclic eclipse prediction function into this Sun-Moon-and-stars Ur-Mechanism radically changes its chronological scale, because at a minimum an eclipse prediction cycle must incorporate a periodicity that brings an approximate return of the Moon to its initial latitude as well as to its initial longitudinal configuration relative to the Sun, and no small multiple of the 19-year cycle accomplishes that.86 The shortest common period of the 235-month calendrical period and the 223-month Saros period on which the Mechanism's eclipse function is based is 52,405 months, or 4237 years, so that any configuration involving a Saros cycle together with a 19-year cycle would effectively pertain to a unique date within any practical span of time to which the device would ever be set.

    "Now the still earlier [astronomers] assumed in a rather rough way that this time-interval comprised 6585 1/3 days; for they saw that in an [interval] of this size 223 months were completed, and 239 restitutions of anomaly, and 242 [restitutions] of latitude, and 241 circuits in longitude plus 10 2/3 °, which is the same number [of degrees] as the Sun takes up over its 18 revolutions in the aforesaid time-interval, such that the [longitudinal] restitions of [the Sun and Moon] are reckoned relative to the fixed stars. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "They called this time-interval periodikos as being the first [i.e. shortest time-interval] that brings the various motions approximately to one and the same restitution. And so that they could make it comprise a whole number of days, they tripled the 6585 1/2 days and obtained the number 19656 days, which they called exeligmos…. Ptolemy is vague about the chronology of these \"astronomers of the past\" (οἱ παλαιοὶ μαθηματικοί) and their \"still earlier\" predecessors (οἱ ἔτι παλαιότεροι), but since just after spelling out the tripled numbers of periods in the exeligmos he writes that Hipparchus had already shown (ἤδη μέντοι πάλιν ὁ Ἵππαρχος ἤλεγξεν) that the Saros was inaccurate and confirmed certain superior lunar periodicities derived from Babylonian astronomy, he seems to imply that the Saros still had its advocates even after Hipparchus's time. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "And indeed Geminus, writing several decades after Hipparchus, writes (Introduction to the Phenomena 18):\n\nAn exeligmos is the shortest time-interval containing a whole number of months and a whole number of days and a whole number of restitutions of the Moon. By \"restitutions\" Geminus is referring specifically to periods of lunar anomaly; his discussion of the exeligmos introduces a chapter on the Moon's varying speed, and he accordingly has nothing to say about latitude or about eclipses for that matter. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "But it is clear that he regards the exeligmos (and by implication the Saros) as exact. The designer of the Mechanism likely did so too. While it is true that the superior parameters known to Babylonian astronomers and to Hipparchus could not in any case have been made the basis of a mechanical eclipse prediction function as simple as that of the Mechanism, the mere fact that the designer thought that times of syzygy could be projected forward or backward with any reliability using the Saros indicates ignorance of the period's defectiveness. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "Any gear train originating in the calendrical part of the gearwork and yielding as an output revolution a simple multiple or fraction of a Saros has to have a 223-tooth gear, one of the largest that the device would require. It was unquestionably one of the designer's finest insights that this large gear could be made to revolve with the longitudinal period of the lunar apogee, so that it could be the platform for a system of epicyclic gearing that introduces an anomalistic variation in the lunar longitude output. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "Perhaps it was in connection with this side-benefit of the decision to give the Mechanism a Saros-based eclipse prediction function that the designer made the Saros Dial a four-turn spiral. Just as in the case of the Metonic Dial, a spiral structure for the Saros Dial was motivated by wanting to provide sufficient scale space to each month to accommodate inscribed information (in this instance concerning possible eclipses), but the specific selection of four turns was clearly dictated by the fact that one Saros contains approximately 16 (4×4) revolutions of the Sun relative to the lunar perigee or apogee. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "The four marks inside the spiral thus indicated these events. One practical application could have been to enable an operator of the device to set it to months during which the daily motion of the Moon was slowest near opposition and fastest near conjunction or vice versa, facilitating a visual demonstration of the variability of the Moon's speed. Although intended to serve as the basis of eclipse predictions valid for (in principle) any of a succession of Saros cycles, the data with which the Saros Dial Scale and its supplements in the Back Plate Inscription were inscribed had to be computed in the first instance from some specific Saros period, starting for the sake of the lunar anomaly scheme with a month in which the Sun was close to the lunar perigee and hence the Moon close to its apogee at the date of opposition. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "Such months are not extremely rare, but on the other hand they are not so common for it to be likely that one of the series of epoch years of the calendrical dials, spaced at 76-year intervals, was likely to begin with a month having this property while being near enough to the date of the device's construction to be convenient as a reference setting for practical operation. And in fact the first months of the calendar years 129/128 BCE and 205/204 BCE, which are the only calendrical epoch years at all likely to have been in consideration, did not have the Sun anywhere near the lunar perigee, whether we are considering Rhodian or Corinthian calendar years. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "As a compromise, the designer chose to use a Saros period beginning a few months before the calendar year 205/204 BCE, namely five months earlier, with the month whose full moon fell on May 12, 205 BCE; and it was only as a result of this decision that 205/204 BCE became the calendrical epoch. Because the two epoch dates were separated by several months, the Saros Dial's pointer could not be at its initial position—in this case pointing straight up—simultaneously with the calendrical pointers' pointing straight down. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "At the calendrical epoch, the Saros Dial pointer would have been approximately 32° clockwise from the vertical, and so the Exeligmos Dial's sectors were inscribed so that its pointer too would be approximately in this orientation at the calendrical epoch. Adapting the design of the device to create the version that we have, with the Corinthian calendar as the calendar of the Metonic Dial, would not have required any change to the inscriptions of the Saros Dial Scale. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "If, as Iversen conjectures, the prototype's calendar had its years beginning just one month later than the Corinthian years, the sector divisions of the Exeligmos Dial ought to have been rotated about half a degree counterclockwise to reflect the reduction by one month of the interval between the eclipse and calendar epochs, but this is so small a change that it might have been omitted. Besides this, all the epoch settings of gearwork and pointer relating to the display of the heavenly bodies on the front dial would have to be shifted back by one month's worth of motion. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "If the designer was active at any period between 205/204 and 129/128 BCE, the choice of an eclipse epoch in 205 BCE would have been an obvious option, since it put the two epoch dates close together and as near to the present as possible. (An epoch date in the future would not be very plausible.) If the date of the device's manufacture was after 129/128, there still may have been motivations for selecting a pair of epoch dates that did not include the most recent calendrical epoch: the designer may have wanted the margin of past time between the epochs and the present to be longer than 76 years, for example in order to be able to perform demonstrations corresponding to historical dates, or perhaps none of the oppositions within reasonable distance of the 129/128 calendrical epoch had the Sun satisfactorily near the lunar perigee. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "Since the designer seems not to have understood how defective the Saros is as a cyclic predicter of eclipse circumstances, the only real impediment to having the epochs in the relatively remote past was the amount of turning of the input drive required to move back and forth between the epochs and the present. In other words, while the dating of the eclipse series inscribed on the Mechanism's Saros Dial taken by itself may suggest a dating of the Mechanism's construction somewhere within the 76 years after 205/204 BCE, other considerations such as the archaeological context in which it was found, together with what is otherwise known of the development of Greek astronomy in the Hellenistic period, may outweigh this preference and favor a later date.

    "Appendix 2. The calendar of the Metonic Dial as proof of the Mechanism's antiquity. The authenticity of the fragments in the National Archaeological Museum as the remains of an ancient Greek mechanical device has occasionally been contested.88 Following Derek de Solla Price's announcement of preliminary results of his study of the fragments at the Museum in 1958, presented at the AAAS meeting in Washington, DC on December 30, 1958, American and Greek newspapers reported the views of a retired professor of German at the University of Virginia, Karl Mohr, that the Mechanism was merely a modern schoolroom planetarium that had accidentally been dropped from a passing ship upon the ancient shipwreck site.89 Starting in 2012 (or possibly earlier), Francis Nimal, a retired engineer, with collaboration from Bernard Tranier, an artisan clocksmith, has circulated elaborate arguments that the Mechanism was a 17th century pseudo-antiquity intended for a \"cabinet of curiosities\", that perhaps was discarded in a marine site, was subsequently dredged up, and found its way into the National Archaeological Museum's collections, where it became mixed up with the materials from the Antikythera Wreck.90 Most recently, Frédéric Lequèvre, a physicist by training and author of several p Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "opularizing works on science and pseudoscience, has written two monographs on the Mechanism, the second of which raises doubts about its antiquity and concludes that it dates from the second half of the 16th century or later (\"à partir de la seconde moitié du XVIème siècle\").91\n\nThe present appendix makes no attempt to address specific arguments that have been raised by Mohr, Nimal, Lequèvre, or anyone else against the Mechanism's status as an artifact of classical antiquity. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "So far as I know, none of these arguments have been presented in any medium that has passed through peer review or other competent scholarly scrutiny. Underlying them is the popular perception—to some extent unintentionally encouraged by Price and other scholars who, while entertaining no doubts about the Mechanism's age, have sought to emphasize the disjunction between its technology and commonly held beliefs about what was achieved in ancient times—that the Mechanism is too \"advanced\" to have been a production of the ancient Greeks.92 In fact we have numerous explicit references to such devices in Greco-Roman literature starting in the first century BCE, right around the time of the shipwreck .93 Moreover, the Mechanism as currently understood fits well within the known contexts of ancient science and technology, for all that it is beyond doubt a remarkably advanced artifact of those traditions.94 This has been the view of everyone who has conducted serious research on aspects of the Mechanism over the past three decades. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "Nevertheless, given the huge public attention that the Mechanism has received in the present century, and the notoriety surrounding several recent controversies concerning the authenticity of various ostensibly ancient objects and manuscripts, it is worthwhile to set out the specific evidence that makes the antiquity of the Mechanism not just a credible assumption but a demonstrable fact. Any hypothesis for a post-antiquity origin of the Mechanism, whether (like Mohr, Nimal, and Lequèvre) supposing it to be a modern artifact that has accidentally made its way into the collection of the National Archaeological Museum and come to be identified as ancient, or to be a deliberate forgery, has to take account of the record of photographs and written descriptions that securely document the fragments' presence in the Museum from May, 1902 until the present.95 Newspaper reports from May, 1902, many of which are available online now for anyone to consult,96 state that the fragments were singled out for notice at that time among objects recovered from the Antikythera Shipwreck site during the salvage operations of 1900-1901, and Valerios Stais, the Museum's director, wrote in 1905 that they were recovered during the late stages of the operations (ἀνειλκύσθη περὶ τὰ τέλη τῆς ἁλιευτικῆς περιόδου τῶν Ἀντικυθηραϊκῶν ἀρχαιοτήτων).97 Newspaper articles from June, 1901 reporting the recovery at the wreck site of a \"slab\" or \"marble slab\" bearing an illegible inscription have recently been identified as likely references to some or all of the Mechanism's fragments (presuming that the Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "specification of marble was a mistake, given that no inscribed marble slab appears to have been a part of the wreck).98 Moreover, the condition of the fragments before conservation, including the thick layers of patina and the loss of most of the wooden casing except for parts lying close to metal, is consistent with their having been in a marine environment for a long period. Nevertheless, we will take 1902 as the date by which we can be absolutely sure that the Mechanism was made. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "It deserves to be noted how improbable on general considerations is the aggregate of scholarly knowledge we would have to assume for a modern constructor of the Mechanism, whether we are speaking of a 16th or 17th century maker of faux antique clockwork or a circa 1900 malicious forger. The front and rear dial plates of the Mechanism, as well as the two so-called cover plates, fragments of which survived adhering to the dial plates,99 were densely inscribed with texts in Greek epigraphic letters characteristic of roughly the last two centuries BCE, ranging from single alphabetic letters functioning as indices to extended prose texts.100 Reflecting the wide range of chronological cycles and astronomical phenomena that the dials displayed, the inscriptions variously employ technical terminology and numerical parameters of Greek astronomy and terminology of mechanical technology and calendrics. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "Some of the terminology can be paralleled in an exceedingly small number of ancient authors, thus confirming the authenticity of the vocabulary while at the same time showing that a modern fabricator, in addition to being an adept in Hellenistic epigraphy, would have had to be intimately familiar with sources not widely read and belonging to quite disparate disciplines, including such authors as Ptolemy, Geminus, and Heron of Alexandria.

As I will show in the following, the person or people who constructed the Mechanism possessed information that existed in antiquity but that could not have been available to anyone from the earliest modern period until the late 20th century—in fact some of this information only came to light in and after 2008 as a consequence of study of the Mechanism.

    "The part of the back dial plate preserved in Fragment B features a set of concentric arc-shaped strips separated by narrow slots. In photographs dating from 1902 through (probably) 1918, the interior face of the dial plate was entirely exposed but covered in a layer of patina through which nevertheless the structure of the strips and slots is easy to make out.104 Most of the exterior face was concealed behind a layer of accreted material bearing mirror-text offsets from the Back Cover Inscription; the part of the dial plate that was not behind the accretion layer was covered by a thick layer of rough patina through which one can barely see traces of the slots but no other features. Source: ISAW Papers 17.",
    "This accretion material and the processes by which the mirror-text offsets were created undoubtedly took a very long time. In photographs from the mid 1950s, following conservation carried out by the Museum in 1953, the exposed part of the dial plate's exterior face has been cleared of patina, revealing that the strips were divided by radial strokes into small cells containing brief inscriptions in tiny letters, which with one or two exceptions appear too corroded to identify.105 Price reports that the inscriptions were illegible, and they substantially remain so to unaided direct observation or conventional photography.106 Despite the incompleteness and damaged condition of the strips, Wright was able to show that they originally constituted a continuous spiral scale in five full turns, divided into 235 cells that represented the 235 lunar months comprising a 19-year \"Metonic\" cycle such as could describe a cycle regulating a lunisolar calendar.107 Hence the main dial of the Mechanism's upper back face to which the spiral scale belonged is known as the Metonic Dial.

    "Because the month names are repeated in each year, their spellings are secure despite the presence of uncertain or illegible letters in individual attestations, and independent of any comparative material from other sources. This ordered list of months was identified in its first presentation in 2008 as a version of the calendar of Corinth, an identification that has since been confirmed and refined by Paul Iversen.109 What I will demonstrate here is that a significant part of the knowledge of the Corinthian calendar embodied in the list was unavailable from the time that this calendar fell into oblivion, probably by late antiquity, until the late 20th century.

    "Before 2008, the Corinthian calendar was a construction of modern scholarship, progressively built from three sources: (1) the explicit attestations of month names belonging to the calendar of the city of Corinth itself, (2) attestations of month names, mostly in epigraphical sources, with some hints possibly relating to their sequence, belonging to the calendars of various localities in Epirus and neighboring regions, and (3) the almost completely known ordered sequence of months of the calendar of Tauromenion in Sicily, derived from inscriptional evidence. (1) needs no justification. (2) is relevant because many of the localities in question were founded as colonies by Corinth, or were under the cultural influence of such colonies. (3) comes into play because comparison of the Tauromenian calendar with the evidence from (2) reveals an obvious relation even if the historical circumstances that explain the relation are less direct and to some extent speculative.110\n\nDetails of the sources.\n(1) Attestations of months from Corinth itself.

    "Most of this epigraphical material was not excavated until the nineteenth century and later, certainly well after the sixteenth century. Alan Samuel's 1972 calendrical handbook, Greek and Roman Chronology, listed the known month names for several localities (Ambrakia, Epirus, Epidamnos, Apollonia, Corcyra, Corcyra Melaina), amounting to eight distinct names, but without explicitly hypothesizing a common calendar.112 Pierre Cabanes produced a slightly different list of eight months as belonging to the \"Epirote calendar\" in his 1976 monograph on Epirus, and in subsequent publications up to 2003 he brought the number up to twelve and proposed a sequence for them.113 Meanwhile Catherine Hadzis (in a 1995 summary of her unpublished 1992 dissertation) and Catherine Trümpy (in her 1997 monumental work on Greek calendars) have offered two different reconstructions of what they designate as the Corinthian calendar, drawing on calendrical attestations for greater Epirus and Syracuse together with Corinth, complete with twelve month names—in Trümpy's case not entirely the same as that of Cabanes—and a sequence for the months.114\n\nTo show how the reconstruction of the calendar attested in Epirote sources was in flux from the 1970s through the 2000s, the following table compares the months known to Samuel and to Cabanes in the 1 Source: ISAW Papers 17.",

The months of the calendar of Tauromenion and their sequence are known from a series of inscriptions IG XIV 423-430 which were excavated at Taormina starting in 1833 and published between 1838 and 1890, and an additional one first published in 1964.118 Of the twelve months, seven match (with some orthographic variants) months of the Metonic Dial, and occupy the same relative positions if one synchronizes the two sequences (Table 14).

A few of the papers discuss the issues of categorization of rituals as “public” or “private,” and reflect on emic and etic perspectives of “magic” and “witchcraft” (in contrast or as part of “religion”), such as the Sumerian “Kishpu,” the Egyptian “Heka,” or the Greek “Mageia” and “Goeteia” in the ancient cultures and from a modern scholarly viewpoint (see the contributions of Gina Konstantopoulos, Edward Love, Philippe Matthey, and Mark Roblee).

    "Methodological Remarks\nThe texts which we dealt with in the workshop spanned several millennia. They originated from numerous royal dynasties and cultures in the ancient world. Some of them might have been transmitted in long lines of tradition. Oftentimes, they were composed in different languages and likely underwent several redactions. One particular focus of our workshop was the rich material in Demotic from Egypt (ca. 700 bce until 500 ce), which has been gaining more and more attention over the last three decades. Source: ISAW Papers 18.1.",
    "The texts feature different belief systems: pagan religions from Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome, and Christianity, among others. During the millennia, cult practices and the access of priests and the public to the gods changed, and the functions of individual divinities underwent a transition. It is therefore crucial to contextualize the narratives in their historical settings, if possible, both that in which the texts were composed and the one in which the narratives are set, which could differ considerably if narratives are set in a distant past.

    "However, our understanding about certain phenomena is restricted by the evidence. Some works of literature survive in only one copy, such as the stories from the Egyptian Papyrus Westcar (see Rita Lucarelli’s contribution), while the “Alexander Romance” treated by Philippe Matthey is available in numerous copies and languages through the ages, forming different avenues of reception. The Greek comedies and dramas which form the base of Elena Chepel’s research have been transmitted through the copies of monks in Medieval times. Source: ISAW Papers 18.1.",
    "Each of these forms of transmission is complex and requires special methodological attention when it comes to interpretation. Another issue is the credibility of the mentions and descriptions of cult practices: how accurate should we take them to be? How do the intentions of authors and subsequent bias or otherwise affect such descriptions, and should one assume that they might have priestly connections? Source: ISAW Papers 18.1.",
    "All of these considerations suggest an approach based on phenomena, or an analysis of cult practices by the methods of the sociology of religion and socio-linguistics, and by embedding the narratives into their socio-historical context. Analyzing the Phenomena\nWhile working in transdisciplinary environments like that at ISAW and particularly within this workshop, it is always practical to start by asking simple “W-questions,” to establish common ground and fundamental differences. Source: ISAW Papers 18.1.",
    "First of all, the WHAT: cult practices themselves and their treatment in literary texts can be analyzed according to their method of ritual category. The Egyptian pḥ-nṯr, literally “reaching a god,” a term for an oracular consultation, is discussed in a couple of contributions (Philippe Matthey, Mark Roblee, and Edward Love). Rituals might contain interesting motifs such as hierophagy (for prophecy) in Meredith Warren’s paper or the intoxication with alcohol whose effects worked like or alongside magic as presented by Lucas Livingston. Source: ISAW Papers 18.1.",
    "Another popular subject was that of transformation: transforming oneself, a person or an object into someone or something else. In studying topics like incubation or the ingestion of alcohol, the literary evidence could be paired with archaeological remains, such as temples where certain practices might have been performed or artifacts from the material world (see the contributions by Gil Renberg and Lucas Livingston).\n\nA main focus of the papers presented and collected here lies in the quest for the WHO: the practitioners, such as priests, mantic specialists, wandering personnel, shamans, holy, old, and “wise” men and women, however they are called in the sources and the secondary literature. Source: ISAW Papers 18.1.",
    "They form one part in the chain of communication between the human and the divine, often taking an important intermediate position because of their status within the élite or otherwise professional or priestly hierarchy. They might be royal or central members of the community. One common denominator is that they are literate and initiated into arcane knowledge. They could represent petitioners – locals like villagers or even the king within the cult practices in front of the gods. Source: ISAW Papers 18.1.",
    "The tasks of such intermediaries were to perform offerings, write down oracle questions, or interpret divine replies to the persons who approached them for help. Furthermore, we could assume a public or audience of some sort depending on the accessibility of the rituals. While in Egypt the practitioners are most often part of the temple hierarchy and male, we can establish a literary figure of the “priest-magician” as a common protagonist of narratives (see Rita Lucarelli, Edward Love, Philippe Matthey, Mark Roblee, and Gil Renberg) – contrary to the Greek world (Lucas Livingston and Elena Chepel).

    "Mesopotamian literature offers more women, e.g., the wise (old) “um-ma” or “witch” (treated by Gina Konstantopoulos, Ainsley Hawthorn, and Rita Lucarelli). This character is completely absent in the Nile Valley.4 In Late Antiquity there was a shift of cult practices from temples and churches to individuals, which produced further specific characters such as the holy man who could be a church father, a hermit, or a monk (Meredith Warren). Source: ISAW Papers 18.1.",
    "Some scholars in this volume thematize a “democratization” of cult practices (e.g., Gil Renberg, Mark Roblee, and Meredith Warren). This means that formerly restricted rituals were available to more and more petitioners through the ages. Other participants of the communication process are gods, demons and other entities people sought out for counsel, therapy, and information on past, present and future. Source: ISAW Papers 18.1.",
    "Sometimes, it is not easy to discern these personages when it comes to terminology (e.g., defining a demon).\n\nWHERE cult practices could take place is also varied and connected to the practitioners: in big cult centers, local temples, royal courts, caverns, or open waters and fields. Tackling the question of WHEN, it is obvious that rituals occurred at certain times of the year according to calendars of religious festivals. Source: ISAW Papers 18.1.",
    "In contrast, magical practices are sometimes performed at night under the cover of darkness. In the literary texts, there is a tendency for cultic action to occur when the story demands it, following the intention of the author. By which means or HOW an individual cult practice has been executed is, finally, another important question: there is a variety of expressions used for “casting spells” (Edward Love, Gina Konstantopoulos). Source: ISAW Papers 18.1.",
    "Many of these practices have been marked as “foreign” (e.g., incubation, the witch in Mesopotamia, the Nubian sorcerer, etc.), though this is more a social designation used by groups in order to discredit the “other” rather than implying an actual import from elsewhere. An exciting and popular literary setting in the narratives are battles and duels of wizards. A story with a quite famous battle is the Second Setna Novel (often referred to as Setne II by the contributors), in which Setna’s son, the wunderkind Si-Osiris, is fighting against a “shaman” from Nubia (ȝte n igš in Egyptian). I have treated this and other comparable tales such as the unpublished Demotic narrative The Story of King Djoser and Imhotep and the Sumerian epic tale Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta elsewhere.5 Here, duels are also featured in the contributions by Gina Konstantopoulos, Rita Lucarelli and Edward Love.6 Heroes and magical battles – not only the ancient narratives, but also the treatments by the authors of this collection – provide an exciting read.

    "ISAW Papers 18.2 (2020)\n\nAcross the wide span of Mesopotamian textual history, from the late third to the late first millennia bce, the figure of the witch appears as one of a large number of antagonistic, if not outright malevolent, beings. Many of these occupy profiles akin to monsters and demons and are described with masculine traits or explicitly stated to be neither male nor female. The witch, however, along with such threats as the demon Lamaštu and the succubus-like ardat lilî, is represented in terms of her feminine qualities. Source: ISAW Papers 18.2.",
    "Lamaštu is characterized as an inversion of the figure of the mother and wet nurse, preying on infants in particular, nursing them with her poisonous milk.1 Similarly, the ardat lilî, who was the ghost of a woman who died unmarried, drifted in from the Netherworld on the wind, disturbing men while they slept.2 Although the witch is not necessarily as deliberate a seductress as the ardat lilî, her demonic and chaotic power is still often couched in terms of her sex. Source: ISAW Papers 18.2.",
    "From these examples, it seems apparent that connections between women and magic in Mesopotamia are overwhelmingly negative in nature. Despite the dominant presence of these antagonistic figures, there are others who do not conform to this pattern of malevolent magic wielded by similarly malevolent women, though these are scarce and often isolated exceptions.3 Indeed, in contrast to the prolific appearances of the witch as an antagonistic figure, she appears benevolently only once within the entire corpus of Sumerian literature, as the “wise woman” Sagburu in the Old Babylonian text Enmerkar and Ensuhkešdanna.4\n\nEven classifying Sagburu as a witch is difficult, yet the witch is our only other major avenue for the practice of magic – albeit aggressive magic – by women in Mesopotamia.5 A number of terms in Akkadian and Sumerian may be used to describe the witch, but Sagburu is not directly connected to any of them. Source: ISAW Papers 18.2.",
    "The most common equivalence among terms for “witch” is between the Sumerian uš7-zu (or munus-uš7-zu) and the Akkadian kaššāptu.6 The male version of this term (kaššāpu) does exist, but he is often found paired with his more popular female counterpart, rather than appearing alone. The word “witch” may cover a range of semantic grounds in different cultural contexts; however, the Mesopotamian figure is defined by her malevolent appearance and actions.7 These are represented through particularly evocative imagery, as seen in the following text excerpted from an Old Babylonian incantation against the attack of several witches:\n\n1   hul-ĝal2 igi nu-sa6 dumu u4 šu2-šu2-ke4\n\n2   uš7-zu lil2 bu-bu dumu dereš-ki-gal-la-ka-ke4\n\n3   amalu ama uš7-zu imin-na-ne-ne\n\n4   buru5mušen uš7-zu uš7 ki tag-tag-me-eš\n\n1   The evil one, the wicked eye, the child of the overwhelming storm;\n\n2   Witch, fluttering lil-demon, the child of Ereškigal.\n\n3   The goddesses, the arch-witches, the seven of them;\n\n4   They are the swarming witches who inflict witchcraft on the earth.8\n\nThe incantation further describes the actions of the witches, who practice “sorcery against a man” (lu2-ulu3 niĝ2-ak im-mi-in-ak-ak-ne) by “casting a spell on [his] food” (u2-e uš7 bi-in-du11), which the afflicted individual had then consumed.9 In literal terms, the witch speaks (du11) poison or spittle (uš7) onto the food. Source: ISAW Papers 18.2.",
    "Here, “witchcraft” is consistently written as niĝ2-ak, as is common in other texts.10 These terms are all indicative of the witch in Mesopotamia, who is less a uniquely identified figure and more an amorphous entity that can cause all manner of harm in addition to threatening the underlying cosmic order of the universe itself.11 Although she may be creatively and vividly described, she is neither named nor individually personified, and the language – in regards to both general imagery and specific vocabulary – is consistent across a variety of texts. Source: ISAW Papers 18.2.",
    "All of these conditions, however, are violated if not wholly inverted by the magical contest seen in Enmerkar and Ensuhkešdanna. Sagburu occupies a benevolent role that adheres more closely to the traditionally male figure of the exorcist, while another figure within the text, a male sorcerer, is representative of many of the qualities more often connected to the witch, irrespective of gender. Though descriptions of the witch and her actions are closely tied to her gender in Mesopotamia, Sagburu is allowed to exist as an exception: a female figure who nevertheless performs benevolent magical acts.

    "The Enmerkar Epics and the Matter of Aratta\nThe literary epic Enmerkar and Ensuhkešdanna is part of a set of four interrelated Sumerian literary texts from the Old Babylonian period, which includes the connected texts Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta and Enmerkar and Ensuhkešdanna, as well as two texts concerned with the hero Lugalbanda, Lugalbanda in the Wilderness and The Return of Lugalbanda.12 These four texts all express, in different ways, a contest between the Mesopotamian city of Uruk and the foreign city of Aratta. Source: ISAW Papers 18.2.",
    "An ultimately fictional location described as being situated to the east of Mesopotamia, Aratta exists within these texts as a foil for and rival to the city of Uruk, a rivalry that is emblematic of a deep division between native and foreign.13\n\nThroughout the four texts, Enmerkar, the king of Uruk, and Ensuhkešdanna, the ruler of Aratta, fight to prove the dominance of their city and, more specifically, compete for the favor of the goddess Inanna.14 This battle may be conducted through more open military means, as in the Lugalbanda duology, where the armies of Uruk travel to besiege to Aratta. Source: ISAW Papers 18.2.",
    "In contrast to this more overt opposition, the Enmerkar duology allows Uruk to triumph through non-militaristic means, and thus prove Uruk’s dominance in these areas as well. In Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta, the contest is conducted through a series of riddles carried by messenger between the two kings.15 The riddles become too cumbersome for the messenger to remember and relay, so Enmerkar finally records one on clay, inventing writing in the process. Source: ISAW Papers 18.2.",
    "As Ensuhkešdanna cannot read the text, Enmerkar is victorious by default, and Uruk triumphs over Aratta.16\n\nWhile the messenger allows the two kings to challenge each other directly in Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta, the contest in Enmerkar and Ensuhkešdanna is conducted via a more indirect proxy. The contest is a magical one, between a sorcerer (written in Sumerian as maš-maš) from the land of Aratta and the wise woman Sagburu, representative of Mesopotamia and identified specifically as coming from Ereš.

    "These figures are each clearly representative of Ensuhkešdanna and Enmerkar, but the action has shifted locations and geographic foci.17 The text may open with challenges delivered from Ensuhkešdanna directly to Enmerkar and close with the former conceding defeat and acknowledging the supremacy of his rival, but the contest itself is conducted by their two representatives.

    "The meaning of his name is not entirely clear: the current reading may suggest a pun on the word for dog, “ur-gir15,” thus suggesting “princely dog.” The reading “ur-alim-nun-na,” which would be closer to “princely bison,” has also been proposed as a reading of his name.20 Either reading is a jab at the foreign sorcerer’s own inflated sense of his magical abilities. Similarly interesting is the use of maš-maš to indicate a “sorcerer,” especially one with Urgirnuna’s clearly antagonistic aims. Source: ISAW Papers 18.2.",
    "The maš-maš most often describes a ritual practitioner, one who in later periods occupies a similar position and shared context with the āšipu, or exorcist, traditionally set in direct opposition to the witch in incantation literature. Here, in one of the earlier appearances of the word in Sumerian literature, the term is divorced of ritual context and instead only references Urgirnuna’s magical abilities.21\n\nUrgirnuna comes to Ereš and attacks the city’s resources and means of food production, using his magical abilities to stop the cows, goats, and sheep from producing milk.

    "He commands each animal: “your cream to your glistening horn, your milk to your back!” (i3-zu si-muš3-zu-še3 ga-zu murgu-zu-še3), thus enacting his curse solely through the power of his speech.22 The livestock are devastated after his actions, to the point that “pen and byre had become a silent house, a ruin,”23 and this attack on the city’s means of food production prompts a shepherd and cowherd to plead to Utu, the sun god, for assistance.24 The plea is presumably answered by the arrival of Sagburu; unfortunately, her own introduction occurs in a fragmentary section of the text.

    "She is first described as traveling to Ereš, a city located “on the bank of the Euphrates … the city whose fate was fixed by An and Enlil.”25\n\nIn characterizing Sagburu, terminology is the first hurdle. She may be most precisely, if clumsily, defined as a “non-antagonistic magic-wielding woman.” None of the terms commonly translated as witch or sorceress are applied to Sagburu, and her name offers no insight into her character.26 Sagburu is instead introduced by the Sumerian word “um-ma,” most often translated as “wise woman” or “old woman.”27 Attested as early as the Early Dynastic III period (2600–2300 bce) and found consistently in the Ur III period (2112–2004 bce), the term is most frequently used in literary texts from the Old Babylonian period and fades from the literary corpus afterwards.28 Limiting our attention only to the attestations of the um-ma found in the Old Babylonian Literary corpus, we see the following distribution of texts wherein it appears:\n\nAttestations of the Wise/Old Woman (um-ma)\nText\tNo. Source: ISAW Papers 18.2.",

    "In Sagburu’s case, the term is tied to both, and it is her wisdom in particular that makes her more than a match for Urgirnuna.31\n\nSagburu and Urgirnuna immediately engage in a magical battle, taking place over five consecutive exchanges of magical transformation. Each contest follows the same general format: the two throw fish spawn (agargara) into the Euphrates river and draw out the animal they have transfigured the spawn into.32 The general pattern is illustrated in the following two exchanges:\n\n228   min3-na-ne-ne agargara id2-da i-ni-in-šub-[bu-uš]\n\n229   maš-maš-e suhurku6 gal a-ta im-ta-an-[e3]\n\n230   um-ma saĝ-bur-ru [hu-ri2]-inmušen a-ta im-ta-an-[e3]\n\n231   hu-ri2-inmušen-e suhurku6 gal in-kar hur-saĝ-še3 ba-[an-ku4]\n\n232   min­3-kam-ma-aš agargara id­2-da i-ni-in-šub-bu-uš\n\n233   maš-maš-e u8 sila4-bi a-ta im-ta-an-[e3]\n\n234   um-ma saĝ-bur-ru ur-bar-ra a-ta im-ta-an-[e3]\n\n228   Both threw fish spawn into the river.\n\n229   The sorcerer drew out a big carp from the water;\n\n230   The wise woman Sagburu drew out an eagle.\n\n231   The eagle caught the carp and fled to the mountains.\n\n232   A second time they threw fish spawn into the river.\n\n233   The sorcerer drew out an ewe with a lamb from the water;\n\n234   The wise woman Sagburu drew out a wolf.33\n\nSagburu’s wolf subsequently catches and kills the sorcerer’s ewe and lamb on the open plain, and the remaining contests proceed in the same pattern.

    "The magical acts themselves – the transformation of each animal from fish spawn – take place entirely within the waters of the river. Instead of any of the vocabulary associated more directly with antagonistic witchcraft (seen before as niĝ2-ak…ak and uš7…du11) the two cast or throw (šub) the fish spawn into the water and bring out (e3) the transformed animal.

    "The different contests also demonstrate the full range of Sagburu’s superiority over Urgirnuna. The sorcerer’s animals are defeated in different locations: the mountains to the north and east; the reed-marshes to the south; the open steppe beyond the city; and the woods, arguably to north and west. Each location connects to a space beyond the city itself, and when placed together, they represent the absolute and encircling dominion of Sagburu’s power. Source: ISAW Papers 18.2.",
    "Overall, the battle is designed to test both the magical skill and cleverness of the two sorcerers. Urgirnuna’s animals, which are all prey or livestock, are easily overpowered by Sagburu’s predatory beasts. Just as Urgirnuna threatened the food production of the city, her animals consume his in turn. The mechanism of transformation is expressed identically for each combatant; Sagburu is simply more skilled in selecting and creating a creature designed to counter Urgirnuna’s own.

    "Each choice demonstrates her superior knowledge and, in a sense, her greater tactical ability. Working Magic: The Fate of the Sorcerer\nFollowing Urgirnuna’s resounding and successive defeats at the hands of Sagburu, he is dejected, his “face darkened and his mind in turmoil.”34 Sagburu chastises him in a difficult but critical passage of the text, first upbraiding him for his lack of foresight in his actions, then reprimanding him for traveling to Ereš to work his magic, enumerating the qualities of the city as she speaks:\n\n250   maš-maš nam-maš-maš-zu he2-ĝal2 dim2-ma-zu me-a\n\n251   a-na-gin7-nam ereš2ki iri dnisaba-še3\n\n252   iriki nam tar-ra an den-lil2-la2\n\n253   iriki ul iri ki-aĝ2 dnin-lil2-la2\n\n254   nam-maš-maš ak-de3 a-gin7 im-da-ĝin-ne-en\n\n250   “Sorcerer, for all your magical knowledge, where is your common sense?\n\n251   How, to Ereš, the city of Nisaba,\n\n252   The city whose fate was decreed by An and Enlil,\n\n253   The primeval city, the beloved city of Ninlil,\n\n254   How could you have come (here) in order to work magic?”35\n\nIt is not the sorcerer’s own magical power that is lacking; instead, he fundamentally misunderstands his proper position in the world. Source: ISAW Papers 18.2.",
    "This passage provides the terminology for the sorcerer’s own witchcraft, as “in order to work magic” is written as “nam-maš-maš ak-de3.” The phrase “nam-maš-maš-zu” is a clear reference to the sorcerer’s magical knowledge, contrasted with the knowledge Sagburu believes he should have demonstrated in line 250. This section of the text presents a consistent use of terms to describe Urgirnuna’s magic, terms that stand in contrast to “niĝ2-ak,” the word for witchcraft more commonly found in incantations. Source: ISAW Papers 18.2.",
    "Instead, the construction “nam-maš-maš ak-de3” utilizes first the derivational morpheme “nam” to create an abstract concept from “maš-maš,” much as “lugal” would translate to “king,” but “nam-lugal” to “kingship.” The final de3 in the line stands as marking “-ed,” indicating the sorcerer’s purpose and intent, while the verb itself, “ak,” is a versatile verb meaning “to do” or “to make.”36 Much like “niĝ2-ak,” there is no sense of malevolence directly expressed by the phrase itself, and instead only develops through the context and conditions of its use.

The sorcerer pleads for his life, begging Sagburu to “set me free, my sister, set me free” (šu ba-mu-u9 nin9-ĝu10 šu ba-mu-u8), and promising to make Sagburu’s greatness known in all the lands.37 These pleas fall upon deaf ears, however, as Sagburu recounts his crimes and summarily decrees her verdict and his punishment:\n\n270   nir-da i3-ĝa2-ĝa2 zi nu-mu-ra-ab-šum2-mu\n\n271   um-ma saĝ-bur-ru maš-maš-e unken-ni imin-ma-ni mu-ni-in-sig3\n\n272   ŝaga-a-ni gu2 id2buranun-na-ka i-ni-in-šub\n\n273   zi nam-til3-la ba-da-an-kar iriki-ni ereš2ki-še3 ba-e-gur\n\n270   “Therefore your sin is a capital offense: I cannot grant you life!”\n\n271   The wise woman Sagburu confirmed her statutory verdict on the sorcerer;\n\n272   She threw down her victim on the bank of the Euphrates,\n\n273   Took away his vital force and returned this to her city Ereš.38\n\nIn her final action, Sagburu casts Urgirnuna into the river, much as she has cast fish spawn into the river throughout the five contests.

    "This action and her seizing of his vital force is more representative of her magical abilities, but in passing judgment and enacting punishment, Sagburu has also acted as the arbiter of the local authority of the city. She has furthermore disposed of Urgirnuna in a way that echoes the legal repercussions of witchcraft accusations.39 Within the Code of Hammurabi, the River Ordeal is used to determine the guilt or innocence of an individual accused of the practice of witchcraft (kišpū).40 Sagburu’s actions emphasize her central position within the city’s established order and even its bureaucracy, setting her in contrast to Urgirnuna’s marked foreignness and his disruptive behavior.

The longest of these, the eight-tablet ritual text Maqlû, provides some of the most detailed descriptions of the witch and her qualities.42 Although its date of composition is significantly later than Enmerkar and Ensuhkešdanna, this text remains a critical resource for information on the witch and her characteristics.

It is only at the end of this list that the witch is described as non-foreign, as a native of the city.43 This well-established trope of the witch as foreign is inverted by Enmerkar and Ensuhkešdanna.44 By coming initially from Hamazu, the sorcerer is definitely marked as foreign-born, and that quality is further emphasized by his connection to Aratta.

In each instance, Sagburu serves as a counter to the witch’s more commonly ascribed traits. Several of the traits of the witch, however, are seen in Urgirnuna, such as his foreign nature and his magical attacks on the animals responsible for the city’s food production – actions, principally, that upset the natural order of the city and in turn threaten the divine, and thus cosmic, order.

Although they are generally described as human, they can reach and share supernatural powers thanks to their secret, restricted knowledge of the written spells and for their skills in performing rituals. Magicians can be priests, wise men, local ritual experts, tricksters, outsiders or shamanic personalities, depending from the audience they address and their cultural and religious context.

Questions of definition and terminology employed in the sources to describe a magician will be taken into consideration, as well as the issue of gender and of the almost total lack of evidence for “witches” as a complementary literary figure in ancient Egypt.

    "Magicians are powerful figures in ancient literatures all over the world, although defining what kind of ritual specialists can be called mágos,1 sorcerer, wizard or more generally “magician” (and their female counterparts) in a given historical context is not a simple issue. It implies a thorough understanding of a religious and social phenomenon, i.e., “magic,” a concept whose boundaries and usefulness is still debated among scholars, who continue to struggle to define its functions in the sphere of religious and ritual practices in different cultures, both ancient and modern.2 The common folkloristic stereotype of a magician as an individual who can manipulate evil and supernatural forces is not reflected in the historical records and the variety of figures who performed “magic.” Instead, we should consider such figures as “ritual specialists,” skilled in techniques of healing, protecting or binding, and harming through the use of rituals and spells.3\n\nIn Pharaonic and Graeco-Roman Egypt, such ritual specialists could operate in different contexts, from temples (as priests) to the towns and villages (as doctors, healers and the ancient equivalent of modern sorcerers).4 We have a substantial amount of evidence, material and textual, dating from the early Pharaonic to the Graeco-Roman period, that helps us to understand how magicians operated in ancient Egypt, in accordance to the primordial force and the god Heka, which is commonly translated as “magi Source: ISAW Papers 18.3.",
    "c.”5\n\nIt is interesting, though, that the ancient Egyptian magical texts do not explicitly reveal much about the magician as an individual and a performer – either about his specific social identity or the way he was perceived by the beneficiaries or victims of the magic he was performing.6 However, the study of magical texts – both funerary and those intended for daily uses – is helpful for catching a glimpse of the socio-cultural context of magic.

    "From them we can learn about the ritual tools used by the magician. Therefore, they provide precious information on the materiality of magic.7 Moreover, they often contain the ritual instructions for the magician to follow, shedding light on the magical and religious beliefs underpinning the magician’s performance.8\n\nIn this contribution, I will attempt to define the role of magicians in Egypt by integrating the information that we gain from literary texts with the descriptions of magicians’ activities coming from other non-literary, magical or ritual sources.

    "The dominance and popularity of the genre of stories recounting the exploits of magicians is well known and particularly well studied in Demotic literature, with the narratives of Setne I and Setne II being the most famous examples (see also the contribution of Love). However, earlier texts provide very interesting evidence as well, and what follows is meant as an overview of the most representative of these texts. Source: ISAW Papers 18.3.",
    "The role of the magician in ancient Egypt\nWho could actually be considered a “magician” in ancient Egypt? In English, the term “magician,” similar to its root “magic,” is rather ambiguous and elusive, since who is a magician, as well as what counts as magic, are in the eye of the beholder and depends on social recognition. The French sociologist Marcel Mauss offered the following description: “It is public opinion which makes the magician and creates the power he wields. Source: ISAW Papers 18.3.",
    "Thanks to public opinion he knows everything and can do anything. If nature holds no secrets from him, if he draws his powers from the primary sources of light, from the sun, the planets, the rainbow or the depths of all water, it is public opinion which desires that he should.”9 This statement certainly applies to the ancient Egyptian cultural context of Heka and to the role that literature held as expression of a “public opinion” (though only on the learned, élite level).10\n\nThe most commonly encountered type of a magician in literary sources is the priest in the temple. Source: ISAW Papers 18.3.",
    "As is clear from the most common priestly titles, these temple magicians could also act as compilers and performers of magical spells and rites. The ḫry-ḥb, literally the “carriers of the scroll,” were the “lector-priests” reciting incantations and hymns during temple rituals and within private contexts (e.g., funerary, apotropaic, daily magic, etc.). They played an important role and were very popular during the entire Pharaonic period and even mentioned in the Bible as example of ancient Egyptian magicians. Source: ISAW Papers 18.3.",
    "In particular, the “Chief Lector Priest” (ḫry-ḥb ẖry-tp or in its abbreviated form ḫry-tp; Khery-heb-Hery-tep/Hery tep) indicated a ritual expert in magical practices,11 and is a title attested from as early as the Old Kingdom to until Late Antiquity (roughly 2,700 bce – 500 ce). The same title is transcribed as hartibi in a neo-Assyrian document listing the court personnel, probably under Esarhaddon (661–669 bce), where it was used to describe foreign Egyptian diviners, particularly “dream interpreters,” together with other kind of conjurers (asipu), as well as doctors and scribal specialists.12 In Hebrew, a very similar word to hartibi is used to designate the magicians of the pharaoh.13 In the diplomatic correspondence between Ramesses II and the Hittite court, a magician appears also in the role of an emissary to foreign lands.14 Both in Egypt as well as in Mesopotamia, lector-priests of the Hery-tep-type played a very important political role, since they were well educated and probably trained in the scribal school of the temple – the so-called “House of Life.” They were involved in royal expeditions as well. Source: ISAW Papers 18.3.",
    "Literacy was important for a magician, if he was to be involved in political missions and travel outside Egypt. In Late Antiquity, for instance, we have reports of wise men performing miracles (i.e., possessing what we could call “magical skills” in a different historical context) such as John the Grammarian15 or Constantine/Cyril, travelling on foreign embassies, for example, to the Arabic caliphates and performing “miracles” there.16 With this type of the learned magician, religious authority and magic skills were complemented by the ability to participate in and sustain diplomatic discussions, displaying a deep philosophical and theological body of knowledge. Source: ISAW Papers 18.3.",
    "The figure of the eloquent magician also occurs in literary tales of Pharaonic Egypt, in which the magician speaks in front of the king or happens himself to be the king’s son. In particular in certain tales, next to professional priests the king or the son of the king is a learned magician with a priestly title, therefore playing the same role of the literate priest (see below.) Similarly, in scenes of temple reliefs, kings are the are main actors together with deities, performing cult practices. Source: ISAW Papers 18.3.",
    "Magicians as “good scribes” and “wise men” occur especially in the narratives of Setne I and II and in other texts of the Graeco-Roman period (332 bce – 500 ce). These show that from the Hellenistic period onwards, literate ritual experts continued to play important roles in the temple, as well as in private daily contexts.\n\nA second popular figure of magician was that of the swnw (sunu), namely a doctor or physician, who in many occurrences also bears priestly titles associated with magic. Source: ISAW Papers 18.3.",
    "Moreover, a magician with medical skills could be simply called sȝw (sa.w), “protector,” mostly indicating a local healer or medicine man practicing at the village level, whereas the sunu practiced in a temple or royal context. The close and important connection between magic and medicine in ancient Egypt is evident from the numerous medical prescriptions mixed with incantations, as well as by the personification of illnesses as demons, which is common in ancient Near Eastern societies.17 Finally, we should also consider the existence of Heka as a force that could be manipulated by Heka-workers who could cast spells to harm someone for the benefit of their clients.18 Both magical and literary texts depict these hostile ritualists as foreigners, mostly coming from Nubia but also from Libya and Syria.

    "However, it is difficult to assess if these figures of foreign ritual specialists were actually part of the ancient Egyptian society already in the early Pharaonic period or if the conception of an evil foreign magician, whose most popular example is probably the Nubian sorcerer in the Demotic story of Setne II, was merely a literary stereotype of a convenient bogeyman in entertaining stories.19\n\nDid “witches” exist in ancient Egypt? Source: ISAW Papers 18.3.",
    "We do not find mentions of the female ritual specialists who, in the Western world, would be thought of as “witches,” in either the ancient Egyptian literary or magical texts.20 However, foreign evil women, especially Nubian ones, do occur in the sources, typically opposed to the “good” Egyptian priest/magicians.21 In a few magical texts we find the mention of a rḫ.t, (Rekhet), literally “the one (female) who knows,” the verbal root rḫ (rekh) being widely employed in funerary and ritual texts to indicate secret, magical knowledge.22 From the sources, it seems that Rekhet-females can act both benevolently or malevolently in society. Source: ISAW Papers 18.3.",
    "In Ramesside Deir el-Medina (about 1262–1069 bce), they may also act as midwives, seers or prophets.23 It would be tempting to compare the figure of a Rekhet-woman to that of the witch in Western folklore, but the evidence in ancient Egyptian sources is too scarce for such an assessment. However, we could supply examples from Near Eastern texts on female sorcerers. In a text dealing with a so-called Maqlu apotropaic ritual, a female magician (Kassaptum) seems to bewitch a victim.24 A number of Jewish texts also mention women accused of witchcraft.

    "Although from the surviving ancient Egyptian sources we do not get any hint of an official prohibition on women doing magic. At least, we could assume that female figures similar to those depicted in Mesopotamia and in Jewish contexts probably operated in Egypt, too.25 It is also interesting to note that the masculine counterpart to Rekhet, which is rḫ.y, may be used for magicians in literary texts such as Setne I (for the magician Naneferkaptah). Source: ISAW Papers 18.3.",
    "However, the title does not necessarily indicate a competence in magic. The term Rekhet can also be an epithet for goddesses such as Isis and Hathor.26 Deities in general, especially goddesses, play an active role in magical performances. In ritual scenes decorating temple walls, gods are depicted assisting the king, who could be considered in his active role of performer as the human ritual expert – the ultimate human magician.27 In some magical incantations, the gods are summoned up in order to assist and empower the human magician.

    "Divine epithets can refer to their role in magic as well, the most popular one being Isis’s epithet wr.t-ḥqȝ.w, (Weret Heka.u) “great of magic,” which can also refer to a series of cobra goddesses.28 Deities and supernatural beings performing wonders may appear as visions to the protagonists of many tales in Egyptian literature as well, especially in tales of journeys such as The Story of the Shipwrecked Sailor or The Story of Sinuhe.29\n\nHerdsmen as magicians\nFinally, it is interesting how even herdsmen could act as magicians, as shown in scenes carved on mastaba walls during the Old Kingdom (2700–2200 bce), such as those in the tombs of Ti and Mereruka. Source: ISAW Papers 18.3.",
    "In these scenes, the men are depicted while protecting their herds from crocodiles emerging from the water. Besides explicit apotropaic gestures such as pointing the finger at the dangerous reptiles, they recite what are called “water spells” (ḥs.w-mw)30 to make the crocodiles blind and consequently not harmful: Crossing the canal by the cattle. Warding off death. Warding off the crocodile by the herdsman … May he come as a sightless one!”31\n\nHerdsmen differ from the learned magicians (doctors and priests) since they possess a local, specific knowledge of only certain apotropaic spells against crocodiles. Source: ISAW Papers 18.3.",
    "However, it has been noted by Robert Ritner how in most of these mastaba scenes depicting herdsmen physically performing magic through the apotropaic gesture of pointing out the finger, a standing or sitting figure with a priestly attitude is the one reciting the spell. This suggests that the written knowledge and the recitation of the spell belonged to a priestly specialist, while the herdsman only possessed the practical and performative skills for doing magic.32 In the literary tale of the Middle Kingdom (2055–1650 bce) known as The Story of the Herdsman, attested chiefly in a papyrus kept in Berlin (Berlin 3024), the reciters of the water spells are called “the knowledgeable ones among the herdsmen” (rḫ.w jḫ.t, literally “the ones who know things”), with a clear reference to priestly knowledge.

    "The story also features a mysterious goddess who presents a danger to the herds. Magical vs literary texts on the role of the magician in ancient Egypt\nThe Story of the Herdsman also includes a water spell on the model of those from the tomb inscriptions and depictions mentioned above, showing clearly how literary and magical texts can be interconnected. This water spell is especially interesting because it has a parallel in spell 836 of the Coffin Texts, which mentions the water spells as well as a “mistress of the land.” The latter recalls the mysterious apparition of the naked goddess in the marshes in the Berlin papyrus, probably in an allusion to rituals for appeasing the “distant goddess” (Mut, Tefnut, Sekhmet or Hathor), known from a few ritual papyri.33\n\nIn the literature of the Graeco-Roman period (332 bce–500 ce), especially in Demotic, it is a recognized fact that the scribes re-edited magical and religious texts.

    "Within the narrative of Papyrus Westcar, the apparent aim of the tales is the entertainment of the king; but they also function as a crescendo-motive to the main topic of the plot, which is conceived as a prophetic text for the birth of the three kings who founded the 5th Dynasty. The third story of this papyrus, in which the the king’s son Hordjedef plays the main role, is especially intriguing. The same Hordjedef is also known as a sage from the so-called Teachings of Hordjedef, a wisdom text whose fragments are preserved on several ostraca.35 Moreover, he is also mentioned in the colophon of a few spells of the Book of the Dead, where it is said that they are “found by Hordjedef, the great sage.”36 Hordjedef’s status as a sage may also refer to his magical knowledge.

This is Djedi – one hundred and ten years old – who performs wonders, predicts the future, knows the location of secret shrines of the god Thoth, and can even “reattach a head which has been cut off.”37 In the description of Djedi’s performance, great emphasis is put on the fact that Djedi’s magic is “written” and in order to be effective it has to be recited.

    "Why is it necessary to sacrifice a fish, in general, and the ĜIŠ.ŠEŠ fish, in particular? Sacrifices of fish were common in Mesopotamia, and offering lists record that certain deities at times exclusively received large quantities of fish, Inana being one example.7 Furthermore, why must Enmerkar catch the fish in a bucket fashioned from the wood of a specific tamarisk? Basket traps and creels were commonly used in Mesopotamia both for freshwater fishing and for transporting the catch to the storage rooms of temples and palaces.8 Tamarisk branches are pliable enough to be used in weaving – the Hopi people of the American southwest, for instance, incorporated tamarisk into their woven baskets when the plant was introduced to the region.9 The cane, rushes, and reeds that grew plentifully in the Mesopotamian marshlands, however, would presumably have been a more convenient source of materials for crafting a trap.

    "As a conclusion to the epic narrative, the passage also disrupts a standard structural feature of Sumerian poetry: repetition. Leading up to the oracular pronouncement, Enmerkar, encamped at Aratta, recites a long message to Inana (lines 294–321) that is recapped line for line by Lugalbanda when he arrives at the goddess’ temple in Uruk (lines 360–387). Similarly, we would expect Inana’s directions to be reiterated in the poem in a subsequent performance of the ritual by Enmerkar, which would bring the action of the narrative to a resolution.

    "Instead, the reader is left hanging – instructions have been issued but not (yet) followed, and the words of Inana’s speech are suspended in the air, never to be repeated.\n\nA partial explanation of the passage has been provided by Jeremy Black, who posits that Inana’s speech is an allegory that refers back to previous elements of the story, in order to bring the whole content of the poem to a coherent conclusion. Source: ISAW Papers 18.4.",
    "He calls this the “‘inclusion’ or ‘embedding’ of one genre within another, i.e., an allegory is included within the mythic/legendary narrative.”10 Black identifies many correlations between aspects of the ritual and previous episodes in the poem, including repeated vocabulary and imagery. Based on these allusions, Black suggests that the three fish referred to in Inana’s oracle correspond to characters that appeared earlier in the story: the kiĝtur fish to Lugalbanda; the suḫurmaš fish to the Anzu bird’s chicks; and the ĜIŠ.ŠEŠ fish to the Anzu bird itself.11 Black does not believe that we can decode the ritual point for point in order to “solve” it, like a riddle;12 nor does he suggest that his is a complete explanation for the passage.

    "Instead, he says: “the content of the oracular utterance is like a dream, in which familiar elements are rearranged and make nonsense.”13\n\nBlack’s account sheds light on one way in which the description of the ritual serves to conclude the epic narrative: by recapitulating, in allusive terms, the key images of the story. But if Inana’s oracle is like a dream, then, dreamlike, it may contain multiple layers of significance.14 Not only is polyvalence a defining feature of literary texts,15 it was also a principle embedded in many aspects of Mesopotamian culture, from the polysemy of cuneiform signs to the portentous meanings believed to be hidden in everyday events.

    "Beyond reprising episodes that occurred earlier in the text, I propose that Inana’s utterance contains both sexual and astral symbolism. Like the allegorical correspondences that Black has identified, these symbols allude to – and, ultimately, resolve – themes that are developed throughout the poem. Both layers of meaning hinge on two crucial items that Inana instructs Enmerkar to use in the ritual: first, the bucket made of tamarisk wood; and, second, the enigmatic ĜIŠ.ŠEŠ fish, to be captured in the bucket and sacrificed to the ankar weapon.\n\nA recurring theme in Lugalbanda and the Anzu Bird is the relationship between human and deity and, more specifically, the relationship between the king of Uruk and his patron goddess, Inana.

    "The nature of this relationship is not straightforward, but imagery throughout the narrative emphasizes its intimacy and its resemblance to the bonds of kinship. The comparison to a parent/child relationship, for instance, occurs a number of times, with the deity occasionally filling the role of the parent and occasionally that of the child.16 Enmerkar refers to Inana as his “princely sister” (nin9 e5-ĝu10);17 and, finally, there is a passage that equates the rapport between king and goddess to the relationship between lovers.18\n\nA marital or sexual relationship between the king and the goddess Inana is a common motif of Sumerian literature.

The extent to which this literary and iconographic motif reflects actual cult practice has been the subject of considerable debate. Although the literary sources were, in the early and mid-twentieth century, used to reconstruct a Sumerian sacred marriage rite involving a sexual union between the king and a priestess of Inana, no surviving Mesopotamian ritual texts describe such a ceremony, nor indeed any type of ritual enactment of marriage between the king and the goddess or her proxy.21 As a metaphor, however, the erotic relationship between Inana and the king serves, as Pongratz-Leisten has observed, both to reinforce the individual ruler’s legitimacy by creating familial affiliations with the gods and to “[sacralize] the institution of kingship.”22\n\nLugalbanda and the Anzu Bird was composed during the Ur III period and copied during the Isin-Larsa period, at the height of attestations of this metaphor, and Inana’s relationship with the king plays a prominent role in all four Sumerian poems dealing with the conflict between Uruk and Aratta.

    "In Enmerkar and Ensuhgirana, this partiality is couched in explicitly sexual terms. At the conclusion of the narrative, once Uruk has triumphed in the competition, Ensuhgirana acknowledges Enmerkar’s superiority by saying: “You are the beloved lord of Inana, you alone are exalted. / Inana has truly chosen you for her holy loins, you are her beloved.”23 I propose that the ending of Lugalbanda and the Anzu Bird contains corresponding, if more subtle, erotic content and that the action Inana advises Enmerkar to perform – to catch a magical fish in a ritually-prepared bucket – is an allusion to sexual intercourse between king and goddess, with the bucket symbolizing the goddess’ vagina and the fish the king’s phallus.

    "Mesopotamian cult statues, representations of the gods that were the focus of public worship, were typically made of a wooden core plated with precious metal and dressed in valuable garments.24 The practice of ritually investing these images with the presence of the deity informs the plot of Lugalbanda and the Anzu Bird: the reason Lugalbanda must travel all the way back to Uruk to ask for Inana’s guidance is so that he may visit her in the form of her cult statue in the temple.

    "In the Sumerian literary debate between the tamarisk and the date palm, the tamarisk boasts that its flesh is the “flesh of the gods” (su diĝir-re-e-ne) and for this reason the fruits of the date palm are laid before it in offering.25 The date palm responds: “You may be the flesh of the gods in their shrines... but it is silver that can pride itself as the skin of the gods.”26 This exchange plays on the use of tamarisk-wood as a base material in the manufacture of cult statues.27 In the context of the Lugalbanda epic, then, when Enmerkar fashions a bucket from the tamarisk tree, he is crafting a vessel (an object whose hollow shape is emblematic of female genitalia28) in a way that mimics the creation of a cult statue, using a substance recognized as very the flesh of the gods.

Waters are closely connected with sexuality, fertility, and cosmic creation in both Sumerian and Akkadian literature.32 In Sumerian, the word a, meaning “water,” is used to refer to semen,33 and hymns describe Inana’s vulva as a “wet place”34 and a “watered”35 ground.

There are a number of indicators that the ritual recommended by Inana at the end of Lugalbanda and the Anzu Bird is intended to conclude not only the text in which it appears but both Lugalbanda poems taken together as a more or less cohesive whole. For example, a number of rare terms used in the description of the ritual also occur in Lugalbanda and the Mountain Cave, the first of the two narratives, including kušummud “water skin,” gišbuniĝ “bucket,” and á-an-kár “the ankar-weapon.”48 Astral content in the ritual would resume the theme of celestial healing that was introduced in Lugalbanda and the Mountain Cave, where Lugalbanda’s illness is cured through prayer to the celestial gods,49 thereby providing, in addition to the resumption of the king’s erotic relationship with Inana, a second means of restoring Uruk’s military might and settling the city’s conflict with Aratta.

I interpret the theme here not so much in the Egyptological sense of Egyptian “cult,” i.e., rituals practiced in a temple or funerary context for the benefit of a deity/deities or a deceased individual, but in the sense of the rituals themselves, by using an approach that seeks to understand how the narrative presentation of these rituals – for the benefit of a living individual – informs how they were conceptualized as working.

    "Against such a background, the concept behind this study arose from the realization that the tales of Setne I and Setne II, as secondary evidence for magical practice, texts, and their practitioners, could be treated alongside the primary evidence for magical practice, i.e., extant magical texts, as a way of investigating how magical practice, texts, and their practitioners were conceptualized. A further aim is to discover how magical practice was narrated, and thereby described, in the milieu in which it was also practiced.6 When coupled with descriptions of magical practice, and of where their efficacy stemmed from, and who was able to practice magical texts, this would reveal how magical practice was conceptualized in both “literary” presentations, e.g., in Setne I and II, and “literal” attestations, e.g., in extant magical texts.

    "The tales of Setne I and II, however, as with almost any tale, contain both literary and fantastical elaborations, and therefore, when treated alongside extant magical texts, it is evident that the majority of the magical practices which are narrated, and therefore whose outcomes are described, in these tales do not reflect those practicable by contemporary “literal” practitioners. They were, as such, “literary” and therefore perhaps considered either “fictitious fantasies,” or maybe even “historical fictions,” i.e., “legends,” that were beyond the scope of practitioners who constituted part of the audience of Demotic literature in the Roman Period.

Hence, this study is not a descriptive summary of the content of Setne I and II and in which of their episodes similarities with, or parallels to, other literary tales or magical texts from Egyptian textual culture can be identified; rather, it proceeds from a close philological reading of both the tales and magical texts, in order to produce a direct analysis of the emic categorization and conceptualization of magical practice, texts, and their practitioners.8\n\n§2 The Context of the “Setne Cycle” and the so-called PDM and PGM in the Roman Period: The Temple Priestly Milieu\nBy the Roman Period, with Greek serving as the lingua franca of Egypt, the use of Demotic in the production of documentary texts, in broad but not absolute terms, had obsolesced, resulting in Demotic following its predecessor hieratic and becoming increasingly restricted in its use to the temple priestly milieu, to the institutions to which the education of the traditional scripts for rendering the Egyptian language in a written form was limited.9 Therefore, as the only Demotic literates, individuals trained within and associated with the temple priestly milieu were the only potential redactors, performers/reade Source: ISAW Papers 18.5.",

Other elements, such as the so-called Book of Thoth and production of ritual paraphernalia from wax also feature in these fragments. These Demotic attestations, alongside the Aramaic version, demonstrate that “Demotic literature” did not belong only to the temple priestly milieu of the Roman Period – the context of this study – but also to an “international audience,” since it is attested in the “lingua franca of a cosmopolitan empire that stretched from India to Nubia,” i.e., Aramaic.37\n\n§2.2 The so-called Demotic (PDM) and Greek magical papyri (PGM)\nRendered in both Egyptian and Greek (the former of which is written in either Demotic, hieratic, or Old Coptic scripts), the Graeco-Egyptian magical papyri are a bilingual corpus of magical texts featuring spells in each language and composite recipes in both.38 During the temporal frame in which the Graeco-Egyptian magical papyri are principally attested, i.e., from the 2nd to 4th centuries ce, there was a relatively fluid tradition of translating magical texts to and from Egyptian and Greek, as well as also within the language stages of Egyptian.

    "An important caveat, however, is that this corpus is a scholastic construct, whose heuristic value is questionable; and therefore, while the tradition in which the magical texts from the Roman Period extant in Demotic are part of this phenomenon, the context of their production, transmission, and practice is instead bound to those papyri which have been attributed to the so-called “Theban Magical Library.”39 This archive included three of the four so-called Demotic magical papyri; London-Leiden “PDM xiv” (BM EA 10700 + Leiden I 384 verso = TM 55955), Leiden I 384 verso “PDM xii” (TM 55954), and Louvre E 3229 “PDM Suppl.” (TM 64218), the fourth being BM EA 10588 “PDM lxi” (TM 55956).40 Assuming that the episodes featuring magical practices in Setne I did not disappear after the Ptolemaic Period (the date of the extant manuscript) and that the so-called “Demotic magical papyri” (dating to the second half of the 2nd century or early 3rd century ce) are the successors of a tradition that ended with the obsolescence of traditional Egyptian scripts, this study will undertake a comparison of the magical practices in the primary and secondary sources for magical practice, texts, and their Source: ISAW Papers 18.5.",
    "practitioners, in the Roman Period. In this period, as noted above, the consensus among Demotists is that no individuals outside of the temple priestly milieu would have had the knowledge, whether in language, script, or magical and religious content, to produce and practice such ritual texts – even while there is, of course, also no conceivable context for the redaction and transmission of Demotic literature other than a milieu of Egyptophone Demotic literates.\n\n§3 Narration and Conceptualization of Magical Practitioners\nAs an approach to the question of whether the magical practitioners in Setne I and II are at all representative of the practitioners that would have existed in the contemporary milieu of the audiences of these tales, this section will treat the identities of the characters, their titles, the discrepancies between the two tales, and the broader observations that can be drawn from these identifications, in order to establish whether these tales lionize earthly (“literal”) or legendary (“literary”) practitioners.41\n\n§3.1 Literary vs. Source: ISAW Papers 18.5.",
    "Literal Practitioners in Setne I\nIt is important to begin by highlighting that Naneferkaptah and Ihweret, both of whom practice magic in Setne I, were children of Pharaoh Merenptah (Mr-nb-ptḥ) (Cairo 30646 4/6).42 By comparison, Setne Khaemwaset (Ḫꜥ-m-wsr(.t)) (5/4; 5/7) has a “foster-brother” (sn n mn-iri.t) Inaros, who is the son of Pharaoh Ramses II (Wsr-mꜣꜥ.t-rꜥ : 5/4; 5/7), Merenptah’s historical father and predecessor, while Setne himself only refers to his father as Ptah in a classically supplicatory way (4/31).

    "Hence, whether conceived of by the contemporary audience as historical, pseudo-historical, or legendary characters, the protagonists in Setne I are all royal, i.e., not simply priests in service. In Setne II, Setne, perhaps Khaemwaset (BM EA 10822, 2/33), is the son of Pharaoh Ramses II (ws(r)-mꜣꜥ.t-rꜥ), while Setne’s son Siusire is revealed to be the reincarnation of an ancient “‘magician’” (ḥr-tb)43 Hor-son-of-Paneshe (Ḥr-pa-pꜣ-nše), who can enchant/traverse the earth and the Underworld at will: “he [became superior] (i.e., in knowledge) to the scribe who was set [to] give instruction to him.

    "The [child Siusire] became […] of saying religious secrets(?) with the scribes of the House of Life (nꜣ ⌈sẖꜣ.w⌉ ⌈pr-⌉ꜥnḫ)” (1/12), i.e., a very learned and well-read individual, given that “it happened that there was no [scribe who was superior(?)] to him in Memphis in pronouncing writings which ‘take-pledge’.” (sẖꜣ nty ṯꜣy⌈-ꜣwṱ⌉: 2/27).44 In addition, Siusire had the ability to read the texts written upon sealed scrolls without unrolling them, even without the aid of any magical practice (3/19–22), i.e., he had some inherent ability that – if learned – was not specified as having been such in that tale.

On balance, the protagonists of Setne II are either royal, or royal and divine, due to Siusire’s status as the reincarnation of a transfigured deceased.45\n\nBy comparison, the protagonists in both Setne I and II are also given titles and epithets.

    "The former (“title”) here designates terms that would also have been used to apply to worldly, i.e. “literal” rather than “literary,” individuals, and the latter (“epithets”) are terms that have not been attested for worldly individuals. In Setne I, the epithet “fine scribe” (sẖꜣ nfr) 46 is applied to Naneferkaptah likely twice,47 as well as to Setne once (4/27–28). By comparison, Setne is referred to once as a “wise man” (rmṯ-rḫ: 4/37)48 – a worldly designation –, and it is only Naneferkaptah who is described once as a sẖꜣ nfr rmṯ-rḫ (4/21; usually rendered a “fine scribe and wise man,” but perhaps better understood here as meaning a “wise and fine scribe”)49 and twice as a “very wise and fine scribe” (sẖꜣ nfr rmṯ-rḫ m-šs: 4/3, 4/24).

    "Thus, Setne is the only character to be referred to with a designation also used of individuals in the worldly sphere,50 whereas Naneferkaptah’s are exclusive to the literary and divine sphere.51\n\n§3.2 Literary vs. Literal Practitioners in Setne II\nBy comparison, in Setne II, the titles given to the practitioners are notably different. First and foremost, although “wise and fine scribe” (sẖꜣ nfr rmṯ-rḫ) is used once to refer to Hor-son-of-Paneshe (7/6–7), it is also used generically five times to refer to a hypothetical practitioner who is required in order to defeat the adversarial Kushite “sorcerer,” so that the “shame/humiliation” of Egypt will not be taken to Nubia ([2/31], 2/32; 3/2, 3/14; 6/36).

    "What is more, the term “very wise man” (rmṯ-rḫ m-šs) is used to refer to the very same Hor-son-of-Paneshe (5/3), yet he is otherwise never referred to by a worldly designation.52 The significantly different lexicon employed in Setne II, however, also relates to the fact that Hor-son-of-Paneshe is given the title of “magician” (ḥr-tb) on several occasions (5/3, 5/10, 5/17, 5/18; 6/14), while his adversary – the reincarnation of his adversary Hor-son-of-the-Nubian-woman – whom he faces when incarnated as Siusire, is referred to throughout as the “Kushite ‘sorcerer’” (ꜣte n igš: 2/29; 3/2, 3/13, 3/25, 3/26, 3/29–30, 3/32; 4/3, 4/9; 6/13, 6/15, 6/21).\n\n§3.3 Literary vs Literal Practitioners in Setne I and II\nAs highlighted in the premise above (§1), emic terms for “magical practitioner/practitioner of magic” are used throughout the episodes featuring magical practice in Setne II and they present strong, and fundamental, insights into the conceptualization of magical practice by the author(s), redactor(s), and audience of Setne II.

    "Unlike his adversary, Hor-son-of-Paneshe, was described as “the one who practices ritual power” (pꜣ nty iri ḥyḳ: 5/36; 6/7, 6/11), “the one who will practice ritual power” (pꜣ nty-iw=f (r) iri ḥyḳ: 6/13), “the one who practices written ritual power” (pꜣ nty iri ḥyḳ sẖꜣ: 6/6), and “the scribe of the house of life who practices ritual power” (pꜣ sẖ pr-ꜥnḫ nty iri ḥyḳ: 6/8).

Source: ISAW Papers 18.5.",
    "The fact that this was only a possibility for an Egyptian “magician” (ḥr-tb) rather than a “Kushite ‘sorcerer’” (ꜣte n igš) has much to do with the semantic distinctions differentiated unambiguously in Setne II between how “ritual power” (ḥyḳ) could or was permitted to be manipulated. The implications of this distinction will be discussed in full below (§4). The differences in the terminology used to describe the literary practitioners of magic in Setne I and II can be understood first and foremost by nature of the narratives in which they feature. Source: ISAW Papers 18.5.",
    "Emphasis on the “magical practitioner” in Setne II relates to the fact that this narrative, in comparison to Setne I, has to describe that the Egyptian was practicing ritual power in order to predicate the outcome that was then described in the narrative, or that a Kushite ‘sorcerer’ has to describe what the Egyptian “magician” does in order to make him a viable threat and thereby a target. An implication of this distinction is that the titles or epithets of “fine scribe” (sẖꜣ nfr), “(exceedingly) wise man” (rmṯ-rḫ (m-šs)), or “(exceedingly) fine and wise scribe” (sẖꜣ nfr rmṯ-rḫ (m-šs)) were not designations that described their own functions, i.e., what they were able to do.

    "Instead, a description of what individuals with such titles or epithets could do was essential for the conceptualization of the magical practices, whose outcomes – but not whose processes or practices – were described in the narrative. To extend the metaphor introduced above (§1), the next conceptual step suggested by the various orthographies for “the one who practices ritual power” (pꜣ nty iri ḥyḳ) would be equivalent to a character in that narrative being identified with a title or epithet that was ambiguous enough to suggest an education in, or access to, the knowledge required for the use of cookery books (with the caveat that cooking could only be undertaken by literates – itself being “applied philology”).

    "When the product of preparing and cooking dinner was to be described in the narrative, but without featuring any description of the process, the character might instead be referred to as “the one who cooks.” Through this metaphor we are able to access the conceptualization of a “magical practitioner” from the perspective of an Egyptian audience, as well as inform our understanding of the semantic range, and therefore value, of the titles and epithets employed.

    "As a result, the question which should now be asked is whether the audience of Setne I and II – while perhaps referring to each other as “wise men” (*rmṯ-rḫ.w), but likely not as “fine scribes” (*sẖꜣ-nfr.w) –, would have conceived of themselves as “magical practitioners” (*nꜣ nty iri ḥyk) with the same or similar abilities as the characters in Setne I and II.53 Hence, while this section has served to classify certain differences between the emic terminology used to refer to “literary” practitioners, and how this terminology may or may not have been applied in the worldly sphere of “literal” practitioners, only following a treatment of the lexemes used to describe the mechanics of their magical practices, and the texts and media upon which those texts were written, can a full understanding of this Egyptian terminology, and emic typologies, be elucidated.\n\n§4 The Lexical Conceptualization of the Mechanics of Magical Practice in Setne I, Setne II, and Demotic magical texts (PDM)\nOne could argue that there is a stark difference between the “causality-attribution/-assumption” that must have occurred when the desired outcome of a practiced ritual correlated with an event whereby the desi Source: ISAW Papers 18.5.",

The aim of that study was to differentiate between magical practices whose outcomes could have conceivably occurred in the lived experience of the contemporary audience, or even been the result of a practice undertaken by “literal” practitioners, and those which are simply beyond the lived experience of any human, and were reserved to the sphere “literary” practitioners.

    "While this study aims to build upon the seminal work of Ritner on the mechanics of magical practice, it should first be stressed that Ritner’s work has gone further than any other in treating the individual emic terminology used by ancient Egyptians both in literary texts that describe, and magical texts which instruct, magical practice.55 Therefore, the intention here is to focus in on the terminology used in Demotic, and highlight the disparities not only between Setne I and II, but also between the “literary” description of magical practice and how this is similar or dissimilar to the instruction of magical practice in the “literal” examples of extant magical texts.\n\n§4.1 The Lexical Conceptualization of the Mechanics of Magical Practice in Setne I\nWithin the aforementioned “papyrus which Thoth wrote with his own hand” were “two written formulae” (hp 2 n sẖꜣ: Cairo 30646, 3/12).

After reciting the second, Naneferkaptah is described as seeing Pre/Ra appear in the sky with his Ennead, the rising of the moon, and the stars in their forms, as well as seeing the fish in the midst, which had 21 divine-cubits of water upon them – the old priest specifying that this is whether he is in the West or still in his form upon the earth.

    "The Egyptian term hep (hp) has been discussed on multiple occasions because of its broad semantic range, yet predominant judicial connotations in certain contexts.56 A consensus that has emerged from this discussion is that “customary law” can be understood in the sense of the upholding of expectation, whether in the pure “judicial” sphere, or in terms of cultural and social norms. Hence, and not so dissimilar from Ritner’s understanding of a hp n sẖꜣ as a “customary written pattern,” which derives from “customary patterns” of “activity,” the unparalleled efficacy of the two “written” hepu (hp.w) is the fact that they are evidently implied to have been written down – “canonized” – by Thoth himself, who has thereby “laid down” as formulae for the way in which all of the outcomes referred to in Setne I can be achieved. Source: ISAW Papers 18.5.",
    "Through the ritual practices provided in the “papyrus which Thoth wrote with his own hand” the hepu (hp.w) were made tangible and therefore accessible and perhaps even comprehensible to a literate, for a “written hep/hep of/in writing” (hp n sẖꜣ) could be “recited” (ꜥš) and also copied and therefore transmitted again in written or oral form – thus serving as a formula for ritual practice. This is exactly what Naneferkaptah did, for it was the priest who first made him aware of Thoth’s hand-written papyrus and then suggested that Naneferkaptah would be able to recite/read (ꜥš) the hepu (hp.w) upon it (3/12–13, 3/14). Source: ISAW Papers 18.5.",
    "This introduction early in the episode demonstrates both how practitioners were described as being able to access and therefore practice a “written” (sẖꜣ) hep (hp), which also reveals how the ancient Egyptians conceptualized a hep (hp), as well as practice magical texts more broadly, i.e., through their recitation. Accordingly, Naneferkaptah proceeds to “recite text(s)” (ꜥš sẖꜣ),57 which he does to overcome the guardians of the papyrus and thus acquire it, as well as to retrieve the bodies of his son, wife, and himself.58 However, when he is practicing the texts from Thoth’s hand-written papyrus explicitly, Naneferkaptah is described as “reciting” (ꜥš) a “written formula” (hp n sẖꜣ), which his wife Ihweret was also able to do.59 With the outcome of the latter practice being that both Naneferkaptah and Ihweret could “enchant/traverse” (pẖr) the sky, the earth, the Underworld, the mountains, and the seas,60 here it should be stressed that because the verb pẖr describes the outcome of a ritual practice, it does not – unlike ꜥš (“recite”) or iri (“practice”) – concern the process through which the practice was conceptualized as being brought about.\n\n§4.2 The Lexical Conceptualization of the Mechanics of Magical Practice in Setne II\nBy comparison, the terminology used in Setne II, while not being dissimilar, is more extensive than in Setne I – likely by nature of the agency of “ritual power” (ḥyḳ) used throughout. Source: ISAW Papers 18.5.",
    "Interestingly, given that it appears to be the only description of ritual practice that survives into Coptic, to “practice ritual power” (iri ḥyḳ) is not attested in Setne I, yet it is used to describe the very act of accessing and manipulating ritual power throughout Setne II.61 Fundamentally, this is a ritual mechanic used only by Egyptians, with Hor-son-of-Paneshe practicing both ritual power (5/31; 6/8) – as does Siusire (7/3) – and “written ritual power” (ḥyḳ sẖꜣ: 5/8).

    "In one case, it is asked of Hor-son-of-the-Nubian-woman by his own mother whether he intends to go to Egypt in order to “practice ritual power” (iri ḥyḳ: 6/1) there, but – importantly – he is never actually described in the narrative as doing so in these terms, which are used to refer to ritual practice exclusively in an Egyptian context. However, both the Kushite “sorcerer” (6/13, 6/15–16) and Hor-son-of-the-Nubian-woman (6/17, 6/21, 6/30) are described as “performing (a) deed of written ritual power” (iri sp n ḥyḳ sẖꜣ), which is also undertaken by Hor-son-of-Paneshe (7/4). Source: ISAW Papers 18.5.",
    "The lexical difference in this, however, is that it pre-empts a description of the outcome of the ritual practice, rather than the process itself, e.g., “practicing ritual power.” By nature of the fact that the practitioners, whether Egyptian or Kushite, perform “(a) deed(s)” of “written ritual power,” they are not themselves undergoing a process but producing an outcome. Hence, while only Hor-son-of-Paneshe is described as “practicing (a) written formula” (iri hp n sẖꜣ: 6/14–15), Hor-son-of-the-Nubian-woman is described as being able to “practice (a) written deed” (iri sp n sẖꜣ: 4/14–15; 6/32).

    "Perhaps the distinction here is not coincidental but meaningful, in that while the “written formula” (hp n sẖꜣ) that features in Setne I cannot have had the same resonance in Setne II, given the “paradigmatic” nature of a “written formula” (hp n sẖꜣ), it is not something that would have been accessible and manipulatable by a Kushite.62 Hence, while to manipulate ritual power in its raw form is an exclusively Egyptian trait in Setne II, a “deed of written ritual power” is conceptualized as practicable by both Egyptian “magicians” and Kushite “sorcerers” alike, because it pre-empts the outcome of the practice itself, a distinction which is all the more relevant when the considerations below are treated.

    "As attested in Setne I, the “recitation” (ꜥš) of “text(s)” (sẖꜣ) is prominent in Setne II, but only as used by Hor-son-of-Paneshe exclusively (5/5; 6/16, 6/22, 6/23, 6/27).63 Indeed, if it were not for the reference to the Kushite “sorcerer” or Hor-son-of-the-Nubian-woman “practicing” (iri) “deeds of written ritual power” (sp n ḥyḳ sẖꜣ), and of course the fact that it was the “sorcerer” who arrived at Pharaoh’s Court with a sealed letter in the first instance, one would be left wondering whether the Kushite’s “ritual power” (ḥyḳ n(-nꜣ) igš) was indeed literate at all.

    "Certainly, in Setne II neither the “sorcerer” nor Hor-son-of-the-Nubian-woman are described as “reciting texts” or “reciting a written formula,” which is attributed once to Hor-son-of-Paneshe also (6/19–20).64 Unlike in Setne I, however, the reciting of texts is not described as fundamental to each and every ritual practice undertaken in Setne II; instead “ritual power” was accessed and manipulated at much greater liberty by – or due to the superior acquired learning of – Hor-son-of-Paneshe.

    "In contrast to in Setne I, when Inaros is described as “giving the amulets” (⌈ty⌉=f ⌈nꜣ⌉ sꜣ.w r ẖe.ṱ Stne: 4/33) to his foster-brother Setne, in order that Setne might leap up from the ground into which he had been hammered by Naneferkaptah during their game of Senet, in Setne II, it is not the act of giving which is described, but the outcome of an amulet (sꜣ). Thus, the extended semantic range of “protecting” (iri sꜣ), which the “bookroll of magic” (mḏy n ḥyḳ) can achieve, is described by Thoth in Hor-son-of-Paneshe’s dream as being suitable for the protection of Pharaoh against the ritual power of the Kushites (5/14).

    "The semantic range of the term sꜣ is then brought full circle by nature of the narrative, in which Hor-son-of-Paneshe is described as acting in accordance with everything he was told in his dream, travelling to Pharaoh, and making for him “an amulet of written ritual power” ([iri]=f n=f sꜣ [n nꜣ] ḥyḳ n-nꜣ sẖꜣ: 5/15). Hence, in Setne II both the outcome and the process of the ritual practice of “protecting” (iri sꜣ) through “amulets” (sꜣ.w) is described, as a result of which the lexical conceptualization of this assumed or attributed relationship of cause and effect can be discerned.

    "Hence, while the Kushites in Setne II are described as using entirely unique ritual practices, perhaps something that would have been conceptualized as “foreign” or “exotic,” fundamentally they interact within the same ritual sphere as the Egyptians.

    "Foremost among the mechanics of ritual practice, as attested in Setne I and II, is to “recite” (ꜥš) texts. Whether as an instruction to the practitioner,72 his client, or the boy medium utilized in certain divinations, or being utilized as a reference to what the practitioner declares he will recite,73 or as a specification of what has to be recited by the practitioner,74 the act of “reciting” is by far the most fundamental among attested mechanics. Source: ISAW Papers 18.5.",
    "In addition, a “recitation” (ꜥš), or – more idiomatically – an “utterance/invocation”, i.e., “that which is to be recited,” plays a considerable role in a large number of magical practices, often in direct combination with the verb “to recite” itself;75 that is to say, a practitioner is instructed to “recite” (ꜥš) an “invocation” (ꜥš),76 although he can also be instructed to “say” (ḏd) an “invocation” (ꜥš).77 Given that in almost every case the “recitation” (ꜥš) that is to be “recited” (ꜥš) is specified in such composite recipes which include among their ritual instructions (e.g., invocations by name, for task, aretalogical statements, historiolae, and mythical allusions), this “recitation,” although oral in function, is actually written in form.

    "Hence, one also finds that both “(a) text” (sẖꜣ)78 is, and “(the/these) texts” (nꜣ/nꜣy sẖꜣ.w)79 are, “recited.”80 With respect to the titles given to individual spells or sections within composite recipes, when more specific titles for the ritual practices are not given, e.g., a “petitioning-god” (pḥ-nṯr) or “vessel/lamp divination” (šn hne/ẖbs), the term “spell” (rꜣ) – better known from afterlife texts such as the Book of the Dead – is used,81 being yet another term that is oral in function but written in form.82 Instructing the practitioner to “say” (ḏd)83 things during the ritual provided the sub-level of direction from the level of the “recitation” (ꜥš) or “text(s)” (sẖꜣ(.w)) that were the sources of the invocations within.

    "The PDM do not instruct the “practice” (iri) of “texts” (sẖꜣ.w) either, because this term is a description of one element of magical practice. Even though this process can be compared with the direct manipulation of “ritual power” (ḥyḳ), the “practicing” of “texts” is a process that precedes it, and by which the practitioner gains access to the “ritual power” (ḥyḳ) inherent in the efficacious textual content of the source text.

    "Crucially, and as noted above, “ritual power” (ḥyḳ) does not feature at all in the PDM.84 The Demotic magical texts themselves, while providing practitioners with access to and instructions for the manipulation of “ritual power” (ḥyḳ), do not describe the attributed or assumed causation process between the “cause” of the ritual practice, and the “effect” of the outcome of the ritual practice – the “literary” describes while the “literal” instructs.

    "Instead, the Demotic magical texts present the practitioner with the mechanics by which to instigate the “cause” for which the “effect,” i.e., the outcome, is specified. Thus, “ritual power” (ḥyḳ) is conceptualized in a similar vein as to how it is described by and for the benefit of the audience of Setne II, and would be considered the agentive link in the causal process.\n\n§5 The Lexical Conceptualization of the “Textual Authority” behind Magical Practice\nIn my study on the bilingual composite recipes of PGM IV, in which I sought to treat not only the practitioner-client relationship with respect to magical practice, but also present a framework in which to ground hypotheses into the “priestly,” “potential,” and “contemporary” practitioners of those magical texts, I reached the conclusion that only a thesis which regarded magical texts to have been conceptualized as being imbued with efficacy that was accessed and manipulated through ritual practice could account for the dissemination of those, and thereby presumably other, magical texts and their practice across spatial and temporal frames.85 This was intended to stand in contrast to the thesis of “ritual specialism,” which imbues the practitioner himself with a socio-cultural prestige. Source: ISAW Papers 18.5.",
    "While that thesis highlights what was perhaps considered the by-product of becoming a practitioner, it could not have been the premise behind how magical practice deriving from texts was conceptualized as being efficacious. That is to say, magical texts themselves held efficacy and “textual authority,” and a practitioner required specialized, rare, and sought-after knowledge, i.e., literacy in stages of the Egyptian language and its various scripts, in order to be able to access these texts. Source: ISAW Papers 18.5.",
    "Only by accessing these texts could the “ritual power” they contained be manipulated in order to bring about the desired outcomes for which they were practiced. At that time, having only treated this in broad terms, and having drawn upon the notable appraisal of Demotic literature featuring magical practice and its practitioners by Dieleman,86 it is here that this thesis of “textual authority” can be developed in full with respect to the secondary sources of Setne I and II, in which the sources of ritual efficacy were described, and magical texts in Demotic, themselves the primary sources which prescribed the manipulation of ritual power through their efficacious textual content.\n\n§5.1 “Textual Authority” in Setne I and II\nThis study has already demonstrated that the source of the magical practices which were described as practiced by the practitioners in Setne I and II were, with few exceptions, described and therefore conceptualized as stemming from written sources.87 The paramount written source in both Setne I and II is a, but never the, “papyrus which Thoth wrote with his own hand,”88 a manuscript often referred to as the Book of Thoth.89 Distinct from the “written formulae” (hp n sẖꜣ) that are written upon it in Setne I,90 and the content which protected Thoth against his enemies and will therefore protect Pharaoh against the “ritual Source: ISAW Papers 18.5.",
    "power” (ḥyḳ) of the Kushites in Setne II,91 the “papyrus which Thoth wrote with his own hand” in both tales is referred to as a ḏmꜥ/ḏꜥm or a “papyrus”, i.e., a tangible medium – with the specification in Setne II that it is not just any papyrus but a mḏꜣ.t/mḏy or a “bookroll.” As such, when the “written formula(e)” (hp n sẖꜣ) are practiced in Setne I,92 or when the ritual to protect Pharaoh from the “ritual power” (ḥyḳ) of the Kushites is used in Setne II,93 this papyrus is the source. Source: ISAW Papers 18.5.",
    "As has been touched upon above, there was a significant lexical, and thereby semantic and conceptual, difference between reference to a tangible textual medium, i.e. a “papyrus” (ḏmꜥ/ḏꜥm) or “bookroll” (mḏꜣ.t/mḏy), and the transmittable and “redactable” “text(s)” (sẖꜣ(.w)) which were inscribed upon them. Therefore, when, as discussed above (§4), a text was recited (ꜥš sẖꜣ), whether in the “literary” sphere of Setne I and II, or the “literal” sphere of the PDM, a source manuscript is implied (when not explicitly specified) in the former case, and extant in the latter by the very fact of their preservation.

    "This is perhaps why in the “literary” sphere a “text” (sẖꜣ) but not a “recitation” (ꜥš) – which only appears in the “literal” sphere – can be “recited” (ꜥš), since, for the audience, the reference to an explicit textual source has to be included: the source of the “textual authority” for the practice is described in the “literary” but prescribed in the “literal” sphere. The key element was, as demonstrated by references to the reproduction of a text not in spoken but in written form, i.e., writing a text (*sẖꜣ sẖꜣ) in the PDM, that interaction with the textual content and its utilization through recitation or written reproduction was essential to the practice, whose efficacy would bring about the desired outcome.\n\n§5.2 “Textual Authority” in the PDM\nThis implication is borne out by a study of the way in which the lexical conceptualization of the “textual authority” behind the efficacious magical practices in the “literary” sphere, i.e., described in Setne I and II, compares with the “literal” sources of “textual authority” themselves, i.e., the PDM.

    "The corroborating evidence begins, after the explanation of one exception,94 with the fact that a “bookroll” (mḏꜣ.t/mḏy) is not referred to in the PDM because the PDM, i.e., the four papyri that make up the analytical category, are themselves “bookrolls.” A “papyrus” (ḏmꜥ), by comparison, appears in London-Leiden and Leiden I 384, where it is used as a medium upon which to inscribe texts or figures,95 as with a “document” (bkt) is in Leiden I 384,96 but also to refer to other papyri which are themselves sources of magical texts.97 In addition, the term “another papyrus” (ky-ḏmꜥ)98 is used within composite recipes to indicate that a variant found in another Vorlage to the main source of the redacted extant text is about to be cited.99 This implies not only that multiple sources were often used in the compilation of an extant composite recipe, but also that these Vorlagen were conceptualized as “papyri” (ḏmꜥ.w), which carried alternative “texts” (sẖꜣ.w) to be drawn from.\n\n§5.3 The “papyrus which Thoth wrote with his own hand” – the paradigm of “textual authority”\nGiven these corroboratory correlations, the final aspect of “textual authority” to be considered, as manifested in Setne I Source: ISAW Papers 18.5.",
    "and II, and relevant for the implications of efficacy inherent in the magical texts of the PDM, is the nature of the so-called Book of Thoth, i.e., the “papyrus which Thoth wrote with his own hand.” Importantly, not least given the discussion earlier in this section, it is not a “text” (sẖꜣ) that Thoth wrote with his own hand, but a “papyrus” (ḏmꜥ). As a result, it is clear that reference is being made not to a particular text,100 but to one particular medium. Source: ISAW Papers 18.5.",
    "This medium could have housed multiple “texts,” which also be copied and recopied from that medium,101 and many copies of that text, or those texts, could have been in circulation at once. As a point of departure, it should be noted that the reason the manuscripts in Setne I and II to be treated in this section have thus far each been referred to as “the papyrus which Thoth wrote with his own hand” is in order to stress the importance of using emic terms where they appear, not only to elucidate their interpretation, but also to avoid erroneous conflations between manuscripts that could be described as similar, but are not the same. Source: ISAW Papers 18.5.",
    "The clearest example of this is an emic term in the Egyptian language that refers to a “bookroll of Thoth” (mḏꜣ.t n.t Ḏḥwty); yet this is not the same or even similar to the composition published by Jasnow and Zauzich with the title the “Ancient Egyptian Book of Thoth”102 – regardless of what Thoth’s role may or may not have been in the latter composition.103 In fact, texts which Thoth wrote are attested in various places in Egyptian textual culture, from temple walls104 to afterlife texts105.\n\n§5.3.1 The “papyrus which Thoth wrote with his own hand” in Setne I\nThe narrative of Setne I relates that Naneferkaptah loved “walking up to the necropolis of Memphis reading the texts which were in the temples of the Pharaohs and the stelae of the scribes of the House of Life” (3/9) and during a festival/procession he is described as “reading the texts which were upon the shrines of the gods.” When a “priest” (wꜥb) accosts him, laughing, he states: “[If it happens that you] desire to read the text; Come to me and I will have you taken to the place in which this papyrus (pꜣy ḏmꜥ) is; Thoth being the one who wrote it with his own hand (iw Ḏḥwty pꜣ i-iri.

Naneferkaptah then has to pay the old priest in order to discover that “the aforementioned papyrus (pꜣ ḏmꜥ n rn=f) is in the middle of the sea of Coptos” (3/17). Not only that, it is in a tebet (tbe.t), either a “chest,” “coffin,” or even “shrine,” of iron, within another tebet of copper/bronze, which is inside one of wood, inside another of ivory and ebony, inside one further of silver, and inside one of gold, in which the book is housed (3/17–19).

    "This tebet is in turn surrounded by six miles of “snakes” (ḥf), “scorpions” (wḫe.t), and “reptiles” (ḏfte.t), as well as “an eternal snake” (wꜥ ḥf ḏ.t). Having overcome all these trials and tribulations, Naneferkaptah recited “a written formula from it” (wꜥ hp n sẖꜣ n-im=f: 3/35) and as a result he could practice the two spells mentioned to him by the priest (3/36–37). Perhaps the most overlooked aspect of this episode is the subsequent event, during which, following Naneferkaptah’s return to his wife, Ihweret declares, “Let me see this book because of which we have suffered greatly. Source: ISAW Papers 18.5.",
    "He gave the book to my hand and I recited a written formula from it” (3/40). Once she had recited from it, Ihweret was able to undertake the two ritual practices already cited (3/40–4/2). Hence, due to Ihweret’s literacy, there is unambiguous evidence, at least in the “literary” sphere, for a female practitioner.106 However, she also declares: “As I cannot write, I was speaking in comparison to Naneferkaptah (iw bw- iri=y sẖꜣ wn-nꜣ.w iw=y ḏd r Nꜣ-nfr-kꜣ-ptḥ), my older brother who is an exceedingly fine and wise scribe” (4/3).

    "Immediately following this event, however, “Thoth found out (gm) everything that had happened to Naneferkaptah because of the papyrus (pꜣ ḏmꜥ: 4/5–6)” and thus complained before Pre/Ra, saying, “Learn my case and my judgement with Naneferkaptah … He went to my storehouse(?), robbed it, and took my chest/coffin/shrine bearing my ‘document of justice’(?)” (4–6/7). Subsequently, Pre/Ra deems that Naneferkaptah “is yours together with every person belonging to him (i.e., his wife and son)” (4/7), and therefore his punishment was that “a divine power” (wꜥ nḫṱ n nṯr) was sent from the sky, after which the death of his son, wife, and himself is narrated.\n\n§5.3.2 The “papyrus which Thoth wrote with his own hand” in Setne II\nHor-son-of-Paneshe, an “extremely wise man” (5/3), having taken a bookroll and amulets to Pharaoh in order to recite magical texts and provide him with phylacteries in order “to not [let] the spells of the Kushites [have power] over him” (5/5–6), headed to Hermopolis.

    "Having entered the temple there and performed burnt-offerings and libations to Thoth, he invoked Thoth for a method through which he might prevent the Kushites from taking “the shame/humiliation of Egypt to the land of Nubia” (5/7–9). During a period of incubation, in which he was greeted by “the secret form of the great god Thoth” (pꜣ sšṱ n pꜣ nṯr ꜥꜣ Ḏḥwty: 5/10–11), Hor-son-of-Paneshe was instructed by Thoth thus: “Go into the library/archive of (the) [temple] of Hermopolis.

    "Open it. You will find [a chest] in the aforementioned naos/chest in which there is a papyrus roll; the one which I wrote with my own hand.”107 The instruction with the most important implication for this study is that Thoth clarified that Hor-son-of-Paneshe should “bring it up, take its copy (h̭ꜥyṱ=st), and leave it against in its place” (5/13). Hor-son-of-Paneshe proceeded to do as he was instructed and returned to Pharaoh in order to protect him and prevent “the shame/humiliation of Egypt” being taken to Nubia. Source: ISAW Papers 18.5.",
    "Thus, in addition to the fact that in Setne I Naneferkaptah did not have permission to locate and access the textual content of the “papyrus which Thoth wrote with his own hand,” but sought it out of curiosity rather than – like Hor-son-of-Paneshe – necessity,108 the difference in Setne II is that Thoth’s instructions make it clear that access to the papyrus he authored was not proscribed to humans, but that removing it from the temple certainly was – hence his instruction that Hor-son-of-Paneshe would have to copy it.

    "This episode highlights an important factor that has been overlooked in treatments of the so-called Book of Thoth in Setne I and II thus far, namely that, as can be demonstrated both with reference to Setne II and to the “literal” temple and afterlife texts which Thoth is supposed to have authored (see nn100–102), both “literary” and “literal” scribes, and therefore practitioners, were, in fact, privy to these papyri/texts.

    "Thus, the connotations stemming from the episode in Setne I, that the content of the “papyrus which Thoth wrote” should not have been read, recited, and copied without Thoth’s permission – hence his divine retribution – have thus far been conflated in treatments with that of Setne II. As will be seen, however, the divine custody of papyri/texts written by Thoth is also attested in extant magical texts, with the resulting implication that Thoth’s authorship, and human access to it, would have been in the consciousness of “literal” practitioners.\n\n§5.3.3 The “papyri of Thoth” in the PDM and Coptic magical texts\nThe last inscribed spell in the extensive London-Leiden is on verso 33/1–9 (PDM xiv. 1219–1227), with the desired outcome being to cure illness.

    "The spell opens with a historiola in which Horus, after doing something which is not preserved, went up to the plateau at midday in Akhet while mounted on a white horse, with a black horse before him. He is described as having “the papyri of Thoth on him, with those of the Great-of-Five under his chest” (nꜣ ḏmꜥ [n Ḏḥwty ḥr-ꜣ].ṱ=f | nꜣe pꜣ wr-tiw ẖn ḳne=f: verso 33/1–2).

    "Horus then asks why it is he has become sick in his head and in his body, why a fever has struck him and why the south wind has touched him, by enquiring, “Does Isis [stop] conjuring? Does Nephthys stop curing?” (33/3–5). With the invocation itself being to the 365 gods “until they remove/conjure the fever from the head of the son of Isis, from the head of NN, whom NN bore,” the ritual instruction is to recite this over oil and anoint the hands, body, and feet of the client (33/6–9). Source: ISAW Papers 18.5.",
    "Thus, it is clear from this spell that even though Horus was the custodian of (copies of) the texts that were authored by Thoth, they evidently were not conceptualized as containing ritual texts with the function of relieving his illness. By comparison, a Coptic-Greek bilingual parchment codex of the 4th/5th century ce, Michigan Ms. Copt. 136 (TM 92874), 5/1–6/5 (lines 60–84) contains a spell to “bring to birth those who are pregnant” and “to close-up those who miscarry,” as well as “to cause every egg to be fertile.”109 As in London-Leiden, the opening of the spell is an historiola, yet it is not narrated in the third person but in the first, with Amun describing: “That I am going is with the south-wind northwards between reed and rush. I am going (to) Abydos between these two mountains of these two hills. Source: ISAW Papers 18.5.",

By analogy with the pregnancy and labor of Isis, Amun is told by Thoth to hurry to her, though – once again – the “books” (ϫⲱⲱⲙⲉ)/papyri (ḏmꜥ.w) of Thoth play no particular role in catalyzing the desired outcome of the spell.

    "Thus, in both cases, Horus in the former and Amun in the latter, the media upon which texts attributed to Thoth were inscribed were held by divine custodians, and were referred to in the historiolae as being embedded within composite recipes that also featured invocations for task and ritual instructions that brought about the desired outcome of the practice, without playing a direct role in catalyzing the practice itself.

    "Thus, while Thoth’s authorship would have been encountered by “literal” practitioners in their magical texts, their context, although not “literary,” was “mythological” in nature – perhaps set in an ancient past during which the gods ruled Egypt. Therefore, while “literal” practitioners could well have been more than familiar with texts ascribed to Thoth, it is not in the sphere of magical texts but in those of temple and afterlife texts in which they would have had access to the actual content of any such texts, meaning that they were once again outclassed by their “literary,” and to an extent therefore “legendary,” counterparts.\n\n§5.3.4 Text attributed to Thoth in Setne I, II, and magical texts\nIt has been seen that although Naneferkaptah was not, unlike Hor-son-of-Paneshe, invited by Thoth to acquire the “textual authority” contained within a composition of his (for Naneferkaptah’s aim was to do so out of hubris110 and to satisfy his own curiosity,111 while Hor-son-of-Paneshe’s was to protect Pharaoh from the Kushites and therefore prevent “the shame/humiliation of Egypt” being taken to Nubia), there is an important nuance to be stressed.

    "This is that Hor-son-of-Paneshe was welcome to take a “copy” of the “papyrus which Thoth wrote,” thereby returning the “original/Vorlage” to the temple library/archive, where it would be available to anyone who had, or in future would be granted, authority to access it.112 Thus, while Setne’s public113 and profane use of the contents of the papyrus which he stole was enough to bring divine retribution upon him, it must also have been a serious transgression for Naneferkaptah to have become the sole custodian of this papyrus. Source: ISAW Papers 18.5.",
    "It cannot simply be the case that because Hor-son-of-Paneshe was granted the authority by Thoth to access the papyrus that he was therefore allowed to practice the texts within it, because Thoth emphatically states that the original must be returned to the place from which he took it, and further that Hor-son-of-Paneshe was only permitted to take “its copy” and not, therefore, the “original/master copy.”114 Hence, Hor-son-of-Paneshe was not advantaged over any other practitioner, whether human or divine, because he was not the sole custodian of that papyrus which Thoth wrote, whereas – by comparison – Naneferkaptah became so, as were Horus and Amun in the aforementioned magical texts.

By comparison, in §4 the lexical conceptualization of magical practices in Setne I and II, as compared with in Demotic magical texts highlighted similarities and discrepancies between the “literary” description of magical practice, e.g., the “recitation” (ꜥš) of “(a) text(s)” (sẖꜣ(.w)) compared to the “practice” (iri) of “ritual power” (ḥyḳ).

    "More central to the argument, I will suggest that divination is a form of self-divinization, i.e., that divination bestows a “sacred status” upon the petitioner, giving him or her access to powers and states of being normally attributed to the Egyptian gods – in both explicit and implicit ways.

The ritual expert in Egypt was priest, magician, and philosopher like the “elders” encountered by Thessalos.5 To understand this figure we need to discard the binary “religion vs. magic.” And, except from the point of view of Roman legislation in Egypt that condemned magia, “magician” or “magic” may not be the most helpful terms to use in our discussion.

    "To understand divination and its resultant divinization from the Egyptian point of view, let us perhaps use the Egyptian term normally translated into “magic,” ḥeka, instead. Unlike magia, ḥeka had no unorthodox, illegal, or deviant connotations. Rather, as both a cosmic force and a deity of that force, ḥeka was “a primary and necessary element of creation, used naturally by the gods, and granted as a … benefit to [hu]mankind.”10 The hieroglyph means “power.” As a god, Ḥeka had official cult status in the temple at Esna in Upper Egypt even in Roman times and was invoked equally as a “destructive force of compulsion … [a] generative harvest deity, and [a] patron of oracles.”11 Robert Ritner comments: “Serving both generative and destructive ends, Ḥeka/ḥeka represents an amoral force inherent in the created order, a power which could be tapped by appropriate words and gestures.

    "There is no ‘black’ vs. ‘white’ magic; both gods and demons may use its force.”12 On the identity of the practitioner of ḥeka, Ritner rightly argues against the hotly debated image of the “itinerant” or “freelance” magician in Egypt. He writes:\n\nPreconceived notions of the magician … on the outskirts of tradition are totally inappropriate for Egypt where the magician was invariably a literate priest, the very source of tradition.

    "The common Egyptian term for magician signified “lector priest,” the ritualist who recited the written spells. Such spells were temple property, composed, edited, and stored in the temple scriptorium.13\nSo, we might also use ḥry-tp, the native term for this “lector priest” – who was ritual expert and practitioner of ḥeka like the one who guided Thessalos – as an alternative to the awkward hybrid, “priest-magician-philosopher.” Using such native terms as ḥeka and ḥry-tp avoids many misunderstandings of Egyptian thought and practice that stem from Greek and Roman – as well as modern scholarly – biases.

    "The pḥ-nṯr Oracle\nAn Egyptian oracle or divination ritual was an opportunity to ask questions of the gods – called nṯr.w by the Egyptians and conceived of as active powers or energies in nature and social life. By means of an oracle, statues embodying the powers of the nṯr.w could be approached by common people to answer important questions on matters of health, marriage, and work and to make judgments in legal matters.16 In the New Kingdom period onward (roughly 1550–1070 bce), “the primary way to consult the gods was to appeal to them during their public appearances outside the temple, either personally or through the mediation of a priest.”17 These public oracles were known as pḥ-nṯr, “the standard expression for an oracular consultation of a divine statue”18 – meaning “god’s arrival” or “reaching god.”19 Gaëlle Tallet describes the pḥ-nṯr:\n\nThe procession of divine statues gave inquirers the opportunity to seek an oracle, and once the god had “approved” the request, the procession stopped and the consultation could start. Source: ISAW Papers 18.6.",
    "This kind of consultation could work through spoken address or through the medium of writing, whereby written questions and names were placed before the god …. In oracles, the god is often said to nod his head … some movement on the part of the priests carrying the shrine would have been required to … indicate yes or no by moving forwards or backwards.20\nHowever, the pḥ-nṯr was not restricted to public processions. Source: ISAW Papers 18.6.",
    "The story of Thessalos’s consultation with an Egyptian ḥry-tp is an example of such a private pḥ-nṯr. Ritner relates:\n\n[T]he most common goal of the procedures … was the direct petition of a god for revelation, using lamps, bowls, mediums, or dreams. ‘Bowl [ḥeka]’ is attested in Egypt from the New Kingdom onward, specifically in spells for beholding the solar bark and the gods of the underworld. The bottoms of shallow bowls are painted with scenes of the sun god or other deities whom the ritualist intends to visualize.”21\nWhether the oracle was public or private, the Egyptian petitioner likely experienced the ritual in the context of a well-established vocabulary of personal piety that demonstrates how certain oracular practices implied personal divinity. Source: ISAW Papers 18.6.",
    "Personal Piety\nSince the New Kingdom, oracles had been connected with personal piety because they were a “privileged mode of direct contact with gods.”22 Public temple festivals “permitted individuals to enter into direct personal relations with [the] god ….”23 Festivals “offered a key opportunity for worshippers to take part in the ritual system.”24 Votive offerings were “placed in the path of the god as he set out on his procession; thus, individuals could address the god ‘in person’ … without the mediation of cult and state.”25 Personal piety entailed “giving god into one’s heart” as in a prayer ostracon from Amenhotep II: “I have given you into my heart because you are strong, … [you] protector, behold: I no longer know fear.”26\n\nSuch ritual expressions of intimacy, in Garth Fowden’s words, “shad[ed] into ‘self-identification’ with the god.”27 Once divination was prohibited at the end of the second century,28 pḥ-nṯr practices were “driven underground, becoming instead a private practice.”29 Like the public oracle, private oracles too expressed personal piety.

    "While “[i]ntrinsically ‘private’ – eliciting answers, revelations, and aid for purely personal concerns – the [private] oracular procedure was no less sacerdotal …”; nor were they less an expression of personal piety and intimacy with the gods.30 Let us now shift our attention to the later Roman period descendent of the pḥ-nṯr oracle. The “Mithras Liturgy”\nThe so-called “Mithras Liturgy” (PGM IV.475–820) is both oracle and ritual of immortalization (ἀπαθανατισμός), part of the “Theban cache” known by scholars since Karl Preisendanz in the early 20th century as the Magical Greek Papyri (or PGM).

    "As a “direct divination,” it is a descendent of the New Kingdom pḥ-nṯr at home with other Theban cache divination rituals in the PGM. The name “Mithras Liturgy,” so-called, derives from Albrecht Dietrich, who believed that the text was used in the ancient cult of Mithras, a thesis now generally dismissed. The more recent translation by Hans Dieter Betz (2003) suggests substantial Greek Middle Stoic influence, in contrast with Garth Fowden and Robert Ritner, who have amply identified its Egyptian underpinnings.31\n\nAddressed to a “daughter,” a female ritual expert whose appearance has been given surprisingly little attention by scholars, the ritual structure of the “Mithras Liturgy” consists of a complex series of “ascension” visualizations taking the operator from the elemental world to become a “rising star” (ML l.574), passing through the gate of the sun disk (ML l.576) into the realm of various gods, including seven snake-headed maidens (tychai, ML ll. 663–673) and seven bull-headed youths (or “pole lords,” ML II. 674–693) – all stellar figures related to Egyptian cosmology – to consult the god Helios-Mithras.32 Importantly, the vision of the sun disk here is not unlike private pḥ-nṯr bowl oracles that utilized painted scenes of the solar Re on the bottom of bowls to aid visualization.

    "Such self-identification with the god can be seen across Egyptian ritual texts from all periods.40 It is “an authentically Egyptian trait.”41 Ritner explains: “Identification of ritualist … and deity is fundamental to all Egyptian spells. The pattern is continued without break in the [PGM], where the expression ‘I am (NN)’ is still usually written in Egyptian as ANOK.”42 Following this self-divinization, the divination proper begins – but, becoming god-like was a condition for receiving knowledge of the oracle.\n\n“Democratizing” Divinity\nA trend towards “democratizing divinity”43 can be seen in ancient Egypt’s long history, especially so in the adaptation in Roman times of the public state cult festival oracle to private pḥ-nṯr oracles like the “Mithras liturgy.” Progressively, “mysteries associated with divine kingship became available to deceased mortals as royal esoteric texts and myths were incorporated in the mortuary literature of commoners” as noted by Edward Wente.44 In the Middle Kingdom, this trend continued through the Book of the Dead with “spells designed to transform an individual into a divine entity and those containing statements baldly identifying the speaker with a high deity such as Re or Atum.”45 In the New Kingdom, priests had access to the Book of Amduat that “included references to its efficaciousness on earth for the living person who [knew] its contents, and it is stated that such an individ Source: ISAW Papers 18.6.",

Especially in the changing ideological climate of the second and third centuries of Roman rule, “the intimate contact with the [the gods] that could be attained by members of a cultural elite … was not going to be confined to the tiny minority that had the necessary wealth and education to qualify for membership.”48 Indeed, the prospect of personal divinity was built in to Egyptian anthropology described by Dominic Montserrat:\n\nHumans were perceived as composites of physical and nonphysical aspects or modes of existence.

    "The intimacy of the personal relationship that “shades into self-identification”50 through word, visualization, or offering – whereby the deity is understood to reside “within the heart” as in the Amenhotep II ostracon above51 – is a participation, a form of sharing the powers of the deity by internalizing those powers.

He won his direct divination with Asclepius, but he does not tell us exactly how the direct divination was performed, except that he was “led through the god’s secret names” – presumably a series of voces magicae (Thessalos l. 23).55 But we might know a little more.

Priests performed rituals in every temple throughout Egypt on the king’s behalf in order to render those enemies harmless, and the efficacy of such rituals was also reinforced by the performative power of the iconography of the pharaoh slaughtering and smiting his foes, which figures prominently on many Egyptian temple walls.20 Indeed, Egyptian temples functioned as a kind of “magical” bulwark against enemies.21 In this respect, Nectanebo’s lecanomancy can very well be explained as an interpretatio Graeca of the Egyptian royal ideology’s symbolic apparatus.22\n\nOn the technical side, the fabrication and animation of small wax figurines by priests with supernatural powers in the Egyptian literature is quite frequent,23 and the destruction of wax figures was a procedure widely attested in the context of oath-keeping ceremonies in various parts of the Mediterranean world.24 In Pharaonic Egypt, however, such wax figurines usually were destroyed by fire, trampling or cutting, but very rarely by drowning in water.25\n\n4.

    "Apparition spells in the Graeco-Roman “magical” documentation\nComparing Nectanebo’s “lecanomancy” with spells belonging to the corpus of Greek and Demotic documents from the Roman times and later, known as the Papyri Magicae Graecae et Demoticae (PGM and PDM), or simply the “magical papyri,” produces interesting parallels and reveals certain features that suggest a (re)writing of the Nectanebo episode sometime during the Roman period. Source: ISAW Papers 18.7.",
    "For instance, the method of gazing into a bowl full of water could indeed be referred to as a lekanomanteia in Greek, or in Demotic a šn-hn(e) (“interrogation of a recipient”).26 In the magical papyri corpus, it was just one of the many techniques – alongside lychnomancy (gazing into the flame of an oil lamp), oneiromancy (dream divination), or necromancy (interrogating a dead spirit) – that could be used to perform what we could call “rituals of apparition.”27 The first step of these various rituals of apparition was always the same: to establish a relationship with a divine being, either by summoning him or by prompting a divine vision, in a preliminary ritual frequently called a σύστασις, “encounter” or “conjunction.” The spell itself, whose purpose most of the time was to ask the divinity one or more questions, could be called a λόγος αὔτοπτος or αὐτοψία (“(formula for a) direct vision”).28 The terminology of ancient magical practices, however, was not absolutely systematic, and instructions to accomplish rituals called “lecanomancies” or “direct visions” did not always involve the performance of precisely the same steps. Source: ISAW Papers 18.7.",
    "Spells were often adjusted and combined with other techniques to allow for a wider range of purpose and expected outcomes. In our case, though, some spells from the magical papyri do contain ritual instructions that closely mirror the actions of Nectanebo, as described in the Alexander Romance. The most obvious example is the Greek charm PGM 4.154–285.29 According to ll. 164–169 the main purpose of this spell was to allow the user to obtain a “direct vision through bowl divination” (διὰ λεκάνης αὐτόπτου): “beholding the god (θεωρῶν τὸν θεὸν) in the water and hearing a voice from the god, which speaks in verses in answer to whatever you want. Source: ISAW Papers 18.7.",
    "You will attain/see (οἴσεις/ὄψεις?) both the ruler of the universe and whatever you command, and he will speak on other matters which you ask about.” The technical instructions of this ritual are much longer than the procedure followed by Nectanebo, but one passage in particular (ll. 224–234) provides a close parallel to the Alexander Romance. There, the spell is again called a “direct vision of bowl divination,” as well as a “necromantic inquiry” (αὐτοπτικῆς λεκανομαντείας καὶ νεκυοαγογῆς σκέψις), and it informs the user that the nature of the spirit summoned depends on the type of water poured in the bowl: for instance, if the petitioner uses rainwater (ζήνιον [ὕδωρ], he will summon the “heavenly gods” (ἐπουρανίους θεούς). Source: ISAW Papers 18.7.",
    "This is very similar to A, in which Nectanebo uses rainwater (ὕδατος ὀμβρίου) and calls upon “angels” and the Libyan god Ammon (τοὺς ἀγγέλους καὶ θεὸν Λιβύης Ἄμμωνα). To invoke the spirits of the dead (νέκυας), on the other hand, PGM IV.154–285 recommends using spring water (πηγαῖον), which also happens to be the type of water Nectanebo pours into the bowl in L (ὕδωρ πηγαῖον), although in that case he summons “gods of the spells” (θεοὺς τῶν ἐπῳδῶν), “etherial spirits” (ἀέρια πνεύματα) and the “demons below the earth” (καταχθονίους δαίμονας). Source: ISAW Papers 18.7.",
    "According to PGM 4.154–285, after adding green olive oil in the water and uttering the spell’s formula (a step not included in the Romance), the spell caster could then see and talk with the divine being, just as it is said that Nectanebo was able to see and confer with his gods in the second instance of his “lecanomancy.” It seems, then, that the authors of both A and L of the Alexander Romance, when constructing the Nectanebo episode and describing the ritual of his “lecanomancy,” might have known and closely followed ritual instructions very similar to the ones found in the Greek divination spell from PGM 4.154–285.30\n\n5.

    "Nectanebo’s “lecanomancy” as an adaptation of a Pharaonic oracular ritual\nNectanebo’s “lecanomancy” and the other PGM/PDM apparition spells moreover appear to loosely mirror the sequence of actions and the purposes of a series of pharaonic Egyptian oracular rituals known as pḥ-nṯr (a phrase that can be alternately translated as “divine audience,” “petition to the god,” or “to interrogate/reach the god”). Source: ISAW Papers 18.7.",
    "Within the PDM, pḥ-nṯr appears to refer to a specific type of oneiromantic apparition spell, but in the Egyptian documentation from the Pharaonic period it actually is the name of a public or semi-public oracular consultation in which a petitioner could consult a divinity.31 It is for instance attested several times to describe an oracular hearing given by the god Amun in the great inscription of Djehutymose in the temple of Karnak (court IV, during the reign of Pinedjem II of the 21st dynasty). Source: ISAW Papers 18.7.",
    "This inscription describes how on one day at the beginning of the 1st millennium bce, the great chamberlain Djehutymose asked the god for the confirmation of his priestly office and the absolution concerning some crime of which he was accused (he obtained it). The translation “divine audience” for pḥ-nṯr was first proposed by the Egyptologist Jean-Marie Kruchten to highlight the parallels observed between this type of oracular consultation with the god and the royal audiences with the pharaoh.32 The pḥ-nṯr of the Demotic “magical” papyri could very well be an adaptation of the ancient oracular pḥ-nṯr, with the purpose of provoking a divine apparition and to reproduce in private the conditions of these “divine audiences.”33\n\nBut oracular pḥ-nṯr rituals were not limited to the consultation of a divine being, whether in a public or semi-public oracular session, or in a private, oneiric context. A Hieroglyphic papyrus [BM 10587r]34 containing an oracular decree uttered by the god Thoth thus mentions the protection granted by the divinity against curses, demoniac aggressions, and the effect of every “evil petition/evil oracle to the god” (pḥ-n-nṯr bin).35 In this context, it seems that the power of a divine being summoned during a pḥ-nṯr could be used with ill intent to inflict a curse or a disease on another person. Source: ISAW Papers 18.7.",
    "The same notion is also expressed in the legal proceedings of judgment concerning the failed “Harem conspiracy” conducted against Ramses III by some of his courtesans (1185–1151 bce): in Lee 1. 3–5, for instance, one of the convicted conspirers is accused of having “contacted the divinity” (pḥ-nṯr) in order to cause the guards to become sleepy, and then to have fabricated little figures of wax bearing some inscriptions (rmṯ n mnḥ sš.w), with the intent to further enchant (ḥkȝ.w) and confuse (stwhȝ) the persons in the palace.36 Here, the function of the ritual practice called a pḥ-nṯr is very similar to that of the “execration” rituals usually performed by the pharaoh against his enemies. Source: ISAW Papers 18.7.",
    "From these two examples, it seems clear that a pḥ-nṯr in ancient Egypt could refer to a ritual whose aim was to contact a divinity for oracular purposes, but also to call on the power of a malevolent spirit to perform more nefarious deeds. Indeed, a closer inspection of the Graeco-Roman “magical” corpus reveals that some of the apparition spells both in Demotic and in Greek present many similarities in their sequence and function to the rituals called pḥ-nṯr in the old Egyptian tradition.

    "For instance, a Greek lychnomancy from the 3rd c. ce [PGM 1.262–347]37 allows the ritualist to summon a daimôn sent by Apollo (or maybe Apollo himself), in order to ask him all kind of questions about the various arts of divination, and then also to learn from him how to inflict diseases on other persons (ll. 327–331): “And when he [scil. the daimôn] comes, ask him about what you wish, about the art of prophecy, about divination with epic verse, about the sending of dreams, about obtaining revelations in dream, about interpretations of dream, about causing disease (περὶ κατακλίσεως), about everything that is part of magical knowledge (ὅ[σ]ων ἐστὶν ἐν τῇ μαγικῇ ἐμπει[ρίᾳ]).” Another Greek example is the “spell of attraction of king Pitys” (PGM 4.1928–2005), which one must recite over a cup and which also bears the title “petition” (ἐξαίτησις) to Helios – another parallel to the Demotic pḥ-nṯr in the sense of “petition to the god.”38 This spell allows the caster to gain control of the spirit of a man who died under violent circumstances, and to use him as an assistant for all kinds of purposes, some of them potentially nefarious, as shown by the spirit capacity to act as an “avenger” (ll. Source: ISAW Papers 18.7.",

    "After his flight from Egypt and his arrival in Macedonia, Nectanebo, in order to make Olympias and Philip amenable to the idea that the “god Ammon” (actually Nectanebo in disguise) wished to bear a son by the queen, performs two rituals following a framework similar to the dream-sending spells of the magical papyri (Gr. ὀνειροπομπία; Dem. hb rsw.t).40 In the first one (1.5, L), Nectanebo constructs a small wax figurine of Olympias, calls upon some “demons made for the occasion” (τοὺς πρὸς τοῦτο πεποιημένους δαίμονας) and, with their help, whispers an erotic dream to the queen.

    "In the second ritual (1.8.1–2), he “enchants” (μαγεύειν) a sea falcon and sends him forth with a prophetic dream to Philip. In both of these rituals, Nectanebo follows procedures similar to those described in the paredros-summoning spells from the Graeco-Roman “magical” corpus found in Egypt, in which, instead of calling upon an existing god or spirit, the ritualist is supposed to create his own supernatural assistant by “deifying” a creature such as a falcon.41\n\n6.

    "Conclusion: Egyptian cult practices in the Alexander Romance and beyond\nThis short comparison of Nectanebo’s “lecanomancy” with its Egyptian background shows that the spell is far more than a Greek literary creation awkwardly blending together two different types of spells, a divination and a curse. From an Egyptian point of view, it appears to be a homogeneous oracular ritual, whose function is to invoke, question, and deploy the powers of a divine being. Source: ISAW Papers 18.7.",

    "Introduction: LOD - Terror and PromiseLinked open data (LOD) can be a frightening concept.Far from the conventional model of research, where a monograph or article is a well-formed, clean, and polished culmination of inquiry conducted in private, LOD is public, often messy, and rarely seen as finished.Somewhat equivalent to electronically providing notes or a card-index, LOD is a collaborative enterprise which stresses open-access, connectivity, and new ways of thinking about publication and research which are often at odds with traditional models of recognition and reward. LOD also pushes many practitioners out of their traditional areas of expertise, with unfamiliar and often intimidating terms, technical jargon, and challenging infrastructure requirements.1Despite these supposed obstacles, there is a remarkably robust community of practitioners and projects that embrace LOD methodology in the humanities, and in particular in the field of ancient studies.

    "This can take the form of a simple script, or a more complex database query.If the external data has a geospatial component this process can be aided by setting spatial parameters: for example, if you know all of the data in your project is in the Eastern Hemisphere, you could automatically reject any matches that occur in North and South America.Depending on the data contained within a project and an external LOD source such matches could be refined even further, by restricting the data type (only matching people records, only matching places that are settlements, etc.), date range, or any other data attribute.

    "As a result, 1 BCE becomes 0000 in ISO8601 terms, 2 BCE becomes -0001, and so on.Second, while the insistence that years are represented by least four digits is unchanged, it is now permissible to express past or future years with more than four digits.The ISO8601 standard also provides a standard notation for temporal intervals, which are perhaps more common than single dates in ancient-world datasets. Source: Time for Linked Open Data. Adam Rabinowitz. ISAW Papers 20.3 (2021)",
    "This notation takes the form <start date><end date>, where start and end dates are both expressed according to the standard.So in our hypothetical spreadsheet of papyri, we might take the value 4th-3rd c. BCE and represent it as -0398-0199, where -0398 is 399 BCE (the first year in the 4th century) and -0199 is 200 BCE (the last year in the 3rd).The date of an Egyptian papyrus signed on the first of the month of Tubi in the fifth year of the reign of Trajan can be represented as 0101-12-26 (that is, December 26, 101 CE, the proleptic Gregorian equivalent of that Egyptian month and Roman regnal year).7 The use of this standard representation of dates increases the potential for visualization, reuse, and aggregation of the dataset, even without any further Linked Data measures.

    "Tools are also emerging to facilitate the automated rendering of natural-language temporal expressions in ISO8601-compatible formats.8 On the other hand, the first representation implies a precision and a degree of certainty that may not have been present in the original statement: around the 4th or 3rd century BCE is not the same as between the precise dates of 399 and 200 BCE.The Library of Congress has recently addressed this problem with an extension to the ISO8601 standard, the Extended Date-Time Format (EDTF), which includes notations to express approximation, uncertainty, and missing information.9 It also permits the addition of the letter Y before the first numeral of a year with more than four digits, to avoid confusion (so the date 10001 would become -Y10000), and specifies ways to indicate precision with the annotation of significant digits.If the dataset was not created with a set format for dates, it may also be necessary to clean and standardize the existing date values before converting them to the ISO8601 standard.

    "With period terms, however, there is no internationally agreed-on, language-independent format or standard: while the underlying concept of a period term like Late Antiquity may be recognizable, each country, each discipline, each school of thought within a discipline understands its temporal boundaries somewhat differently, and some use other terms altogether to describe the same conceptual entity. Source: Time for Linked Open Data. Adam Rabinowitz. ISAW Papers 20.3 (2021)",
    "One way to deal with this lack of standardization is to express clearly within a dataset what is meant by a specific term.After ontological mapping that makes it clear that the entity involved is a temporal period, an internal defined vocabulary with specified dates may be used to provide valid values for the period element.This is the way the Pleiades project, for example, organizes its references to periods, which appear as follows in the RDF+XML representation of Late Antique period in a specific place record. the place in question is attested in the historical record within a named timespan; the skos:Concept element refers to the Simple Knowledge Organization System datamodel, explaining that the named timespan is a conceptual object;20 and the rdf:about element points to a local defined vocabulary or thesaurus.21 In the Pleiades gazetteer, the definition of the period in time (and in some cases, though not here, in space) is contained in the period's name (AD 300-AD 640), and explained in more detail in the scope note.There is an additional piece of information here, however.

    "Even if full ontological modeling is not possible for a given dataset or data manager, named entities can still be mapped to external vocabularies that have already carried out that descriptive work, and can serve as shared points of reference to help connect datasets that use different terms or concepts.Several of these external resources are available for temporal data.The most well-known is the Getty AAT, which maintains an extensive period vocabulary.22 Getty AAT identifiers for periods offer the advantage of a single conceptual representation for named entities that appear in idiosyncratic forms in individual sources.

    "This advantage comes at the cost, however, of specific temporal boundaries: if Iron Age is to be a valid concept on a global level, it cannot be defined by dates that apply only in one place, so the only structured references to calendar time in the semantic representation of Iron Age in the Getty AAT refer to the creation and modification of the record itself.Temporal information about the period boundaries is expressed only in the note, which explains that the Iron Age developed at different times in various parts of the world, first appearing in the Middle East and southeastern Europe around 1,200 BCE, and in China around 600 BCE.

    "Like the Getty AAT, chronOntology provides URIs for periods, but because these entities are associated with both temporal and spatial boundaries, they make it easier to compare their duration with that of similar conceptual entities in other places (this comparison is further assisted by a timeline visualization of related concepts in the current interface). A search for the term Late Antique, for example, produces three unique, dated matches from the chronOntology dataset, which are distinguished by type (in terms of the domain where the temporal entity is used: politics, culture, material culture, architecture), source, andor date range.25 We might choose one of these as a definition for our own use of Late Antique in our spreadsheet, and we could add its URI to a new column in which the URI appears for every row where an item has already been classified as Late Antique.

    "The chronOntology platform has the added virtue of a union search across other period vocabularies u2013 specifically, the Getty AAT and the PeriodO gazetteer.Where the Getty AAT and the chronOntology dataset have attempted to unify period definitions under the smallest number of conceptual headings possible u2013 on the assumption that two different users are likely to have the same concept in mind when they apply the label Bronze Age, and different opinions on specific spatiotemporal bounds can be reconciled within a single concept u2013 the PeriodO gazetteer of period definitions has taken a different approach (Rabinowitz et al. 2016).26 Like the Getty AAT and chronOntology, it presents a semantic model for named conceptual entities and provides URIs for instances of those entities; but unlike those resources, its basic unit of analysis is a named period as defined in time and space by an individual authoritative source.

    "The Getty AAT provides a URI for the Iron Age in the most general sense of the term; chronOntology provides URIs for period concepts that seem to be broadly accepted in a particular region, and as a result includes far more information about spatial and temporal boundaries than the AAT.Both resources, however, focus on the abstract concept more than concrete usage, and therefore include period designations that lack specific coordinates in space or time or both.

    "Because PeriodO seeks to capture spatiotemporal usage rather than unified concepts, it only includes period definitions with coordinates in both space and time u2013 and because usage can vary from authority to authority even with reference to the same abstract concept in the same place, it sets no limit on the number of varying spatiotemporal definitions related to the same abstract concept.PeriodO is thus the most granular of the these three sources, and allows the most specific definition of the meaning of Late Antique in a given context: not the Getty AAT's broadest period in history and the style of art that developed after Severan rule in the Roman Empire, nor chronOntology's general definition for the Mediterranean as inferred from a particular publication, but Late Antique exactly as defined by the British Museum with respect to Greece, Cyprus, eastern Balkans, parts of the Caucasus (Georgia, Armenia, etc.), Asia Minor, Levant, Egypt and parts of Italy, in the original language and terms of the source (with the addition of an ISO8601 representation of the dates and an English translation of non-English labels).The sample table with the addition of a column for period URIs fromSource: Time for Linked Open Data.

    "But when the data in that spreadsheet are mapped to a semantic-web datamodel like that of the Resource Description Format (RDF) (Heath and Bizer 2011) and expressed in that format or another serialization such as JSON-LD,31 the use of a URI from an external resource in connection with a value in the dataset makes it possible for that dataset to be connected to the broader web of Linked Data.To walk through Berners-Lee's five stars with our spreadsheet, we can acquire the first star simply by publishing a screenshot of the spreadsheet to the web under an open license; by making the original Excel spreadsheet itself available under an open license, we've already expressed the data in machine-readable structured form, which gets us a second star; and if we make that spreadsheet available in a non-proprietary format like CSV, we reach three stars.

A period can be attached to an EpiDoc record according the following basic format, using the @period attribute and an external URI:t<origDate notBefore=0501 notAfter=0700 period=http:n2t.netark:99152p08m57hmdw6>Late Antique<origDate>In the origDate element, EpiDoc permits the addition of notations that specify the precision of the temporal boundaries with the @precision attribute (e.g. precision=medium) and the type of evidence on which the dating is based with the @evidence attribute (e.g. evidence=lettering).

    "The specification also states that the period referenced need not correspond to the numerical date range offered, so that a given inscription can be associated with both its own absolute dates and a broader cultural or stylistic period.33The Pelagios Gazetteer Interchange Format (PGIF) was the format developed to connect places between different gazetteers in order to aggregate spatial data from the ancient world and to facilitate the creation of new Linked Data through semantic annotation platforms like Recogito.34 Because both the names and locations of places are time-dependent, this standard included ways to associate places with timespans.

    "The body of information about any given person or collection of people is often expressed, or held in the scholar's mind, as a fluid, more or less chronological narrative, or as a collection of events and statements given to us by sources and placed in a historical context.Adding structure, or applying a model, to this information inevitably means distorting it: forcing some kinds of information into controlled vocabularies or restrictive typologies, leaving out details or elements that don't fit the model, making assumptions where required fields are missing from history.

    "A model, although (and indeed because) structured, is always misleading, distorting, imperfect.We have to mitigate this degrading of information by: assiduously documenting the model and the decisions made to fit our data into it; by supplementing the structured data with free-text descriptions for the human reader of features not expressed in LOD; by ensuring that the use we or a computer will make of the economies of scale or pattern detection made possible by implementing the model are worth the signal-loss; and by being explicit about the historical (and secondary) sources that feed into our data, so that a reader can go back to the start and check the raw data that we are thus perverting.2 In other words, if we extract information from a variety of sources to populate a uniform database record with names, dates, titles, relationships, and other data about a person, all of the sources, definitions, decisions and mechanisms for populating the individual fields should be preserved.Having said this, the nature of person-data as involving relationships between entities, places, persons, and other sorts of data and vocabularies, means that once structured or modelled as described abSource: Linked Open Data for Ancient Names and People.

    "The attested event other piece of information (factoid rather than fact because counter-factual or internally inconsistent attestations are valid entities in a prosopographical dataset) is both the glue that links together persons, primary and secondary texts, places, dates, and the other tables of the database, and one of the building blocks from which all person records are built.For example, a factoid relating to a database of person information relating to ancient Lepcis Magna might be the funerary inscription of Publius Lucretius Crescens, which was set up by his father at some point in the Imperial period.4 This source would then be linked from several places in the database: as source for the existence, name and (very rough) date of Crescens himself; as one of several sources for the existence, name etc. of Lucretius Rogatinus, the erector of the monument; and as source for the relationship between the two.One factoid may therefore be a component of several person records, and almost every person record will be made up of several such attestations.

    "Their name, their family relationships, professions or titles, marriage, participation in battles, treaties, coronations, and other historical events, are only part of our person record because they are attested in one or more sources.This model is therefore not only intellectually rigorous, making sure that all claims about a person are backed up in primary sources or secondary scholarship, but admirably transparent in communicating these sources, and other bases for statements, to the reader.

    "It is possible to browse the factoid database (see e.g. PBW) by any of the top-level entities, including u2013 in addition to people u2013 places, events, occupations, names, and indeed sources and factoids themselves.Text EncodingA much simpler scheme for encoding information about historical persons u2013 although one in which it is possible to model many of the same entities and relationships as I have been discussing above u2013 would be in encoded text, for example in TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) XML. XML is a strictly hierarchical language, so a single <person> element must completely encompass those elements containing core information about that person: name, dates, occupations, locations, etc. Source: Linked Open Data for Ancient Names and People. Gabriel Bodard. ISAW Papers 20.4 (2021)",
    "However, the TEI content model also defines several attributes for linking to other elements or even external files, allowing the stand-off annotation of sections of text, or entities in a separate hierarchy from the person-list. A <person> element might be referenced from several <relation> elements, for example, which define family relationships with several other persons.Several <person> elements might all point to the same <event> element defining an event in which they all participated in some way.A simple person record (with external <relation> given for comparison) in TEI XML might look something like:t<person xml:id=person7>t   <persName xml:lang=grc>u0395u1f50u03b8u03aeu03c1u03b9u03bfu03c2<persName>t   <floruit notBefore=0392 notAfter=0393>t   <occupation>u03bau03ccu03bcu03b7u03c2<occupation>t   <affiliation ref=pleiades.stoa.orgplaces226564>Cherson<affiliation>t<person>t<relation active=#person7 ref=snap:BrotherOf passive=#person8>While this is a much flatter and more linear way of encoding person-data, it would probably be possible (if perhaps not the most efficient) to encode a basic factoid prosopography in this format.CataloguesAlthough they typically contain less information about each person, another very useful source of lists of persons is the library catalogue, or similar authority list of persons involved in a bibliographical, archival, or museum item database. Source: Linked Open Data for Ancient Names and People. Gabriel Bodard. ISAW Papers 20.4 (2021)",
    "The catalogue may say very little more than each person's name and a bare minimum of biographical data (life or work dates, language, genre, nationality), the purpose of the list is to be completely unambiguous and very clear about the identity of individual persons, so that a book (or item, or record, etc.) can be ascribed to the correct person no matter how many homonyms may exist.However the data itself is encoded, library catalogues also follow very strict metadata schemas and vocabularies, and often expose their identifiers for the purpose of cross-referencing with other libraries.

    "Each string of text that contains a personal name or other appellation refers directly or indirectly to a person.Identifying a person-reference is relatively unambiguous, but disambiguating the person or entity to whom it refers is an intellectual activity, and may involve uncertainty, the citation of evidence or argument, and be facilitated by the existence of a list of already known persons.For example, the Trismegistos database of text and person data from ancient Egypt, collects data in several related but separate databases.Texts (c. 680,000 records), the texts, mostly papyri, from ancient Egypt and the Nile valley; References (c. 500,000 records), listing each attestation of a person; will be duplicates even if, for example, the same person is clearly named twice in the same line of the same text; People (c. 370,000 records), listing individual persons once only, however many times they are attested; Names (c. 33,000 records), giving unique names, many of which are of course used by several different persons (there are also larger tables of name variants and declined name forms).This workflow results in an important collection of data that is both a reflection of the activity of moving from source texts to disambiguated name and person data, and a working tool that can be used in the process of further refining and adding new texts and person records to the database.

    "It is indeed a very practical need, grounded also in the necessity not to waste time during the project.On the other side, it is a methodological need, which requires us to offer data in the most complete and most simple and clear way.Although the reading of the book is essential to the understanding of the methodology and it is not my intent to try to summarize it, let me attempt to highlight right here at the outset what I believe to be the key concepts on which La Syntaxe is based (Andrist, Canart, and Maniaci 2013, 7; Andrist 2015, 511) some of which will be better described in the following sections,A medieval codex is a complex object from its origin and is subject to many changes during its life; it carries most of the time traces of these changes which the scholar needs to be trained to identify methodically.The analysis of a manuscript identifies primarily discontinuities and different categories of elements constituting the codex.

    "Elements can be grouped into Units of different kinds which are meaningful.The identification of concomitant discontinuities supports the identification of codicological units.The concept of codicological unit is refined into production units (UniProd) and circulation units (UniCirc).This core theoretical distinction allows to describe the manuscript (indeed not only the codex) history clearly and effectively.The stratigraphy of a codex can be studied systematically but needs a new approach and new eyes, familiar to the signs of the transformation and able to read the language these signs speak (Andrist 2015, 511).The syntactic description of the codex, which is the outcome of the syntactical and stratigraphic study of its complex structure reflects the history of all the units which have been added, subtracted andor modified in the course of its history and accounts for the depth of the tradition, giving us virtually access to the units which are not there anymore and thus allowing us to describe them in their proper relation to the object we are studying.

    "Firstly, to go back to the beginning, Chris and Neel, when and why did you create the CITE architecture?[urn:cts:scholarship:lod.discussion:answer.1]Chris Blackwell & Neel Smith: Casey Duu00e9, Mary Ebbott, and Gregory Nagy conceived a project to produce a 21st-century edition of the Homeric Iliad, an edition based on their understanding of the nature of that text as a product of a thousand-year evolution of a tradition of composition-in-performance. Source: The CITE Architecture: Q & A Regarding CTS and CITE. Thomas Koentges et al. ISAW Papers 20.8 (2021) ",
    "This edition would be a multitext rather than a critical edition; the goal would not be to analyze the surviving witnesses to the text and, when they differ on a line or passage, throw away all but a single, ostensibly authentic version.Rather, they see that in the transmission of the Iliad the various differing readings preserved in manuscripts and ancient commentaries reflect a fundamental aspect of the Iliad: that variation is an essential part of this poetry. Source: The CITE Architecture: Q & A Regarding CTS and CITE. Thomas Koentges et al. ISAW Papers 20.8 (2021) ",
    "When we were brought on to this project, we knew we would need to be able to talk precisely and imprecisely about many versions of the same text.Precisely, as in Book 2, line 4 of the Iliad as preserved on the Venetus A manuscript; imprecisely, as in Book 10 of the Iliad, in all of its manifestations through its transmission history.We also knew that this would be a long task, which motivated us to try to separate concerns as much as possible, on the assumption that generations of technologies would likely pass into obsolescence before we had a scholarly product. Source: The CITE Architecture: Q & A Regarding CTS and CITE. Thomas Koentges et al. ISAW Papers 20.8 (2021) ",
    "Canonical citation has worked as a linking mechanism for centuries, and CITE is just a machine-actionable update to that ancient technology.[urn:cts:scholarship:lod.discussion:question.2]TK: So it was invented by philologists for philologists and as a result it has already been implemented in several edition projects.Who, then, can use the CITE architecture?[urn:cts:scholarship:lod.discussion:answer.2a]CB & NS: Anyone with canonically citable texts or data. Source: The CITE Architecture: Q & A Regarding CTS and CITE. Thomas Koentges et al. ISAW Papers 20.8 (2021) ",
    "So what does that mean?We can start with texts as an example.If you have a text, and you can assign identifiers to work-group, work, and version, and you can assign a unique identifier to each of its parts (which may or may not be in a hierarchy), and the contents of those parts is not going to change, then you have a canonically citable text.This seems simple to us, but we have been surprised at how many electronic texts are put online without attention to their long-term status as objects of study. Source: The CITE Architecture: Q & A Regarding CTS and CITE. Thomas Koentges et al. ISAW Papers 20.8 (2021) ",
    "Scholars with unique texts, or texts with complicated histories, seem unwilling simply to assign an arbitrary identifier to a text-group (especially), or work, or version.There seems to be a perceived need for an identifier to be descriptive, and (with that mistake made), for the descriptive identifier to have the burden of saying everything about the text.This is an unhelpful attitude. A scholar with a newly edited papyrus, for example, can just define IDs in an independent namespace and proceed: urn:cts:papyrins:02034.34.1:1 is a perfectly good URN. CTS URNs, after all, are generally going to be handled by machines.Another stumbling block seems to be the necessity that a canonically citable text not change.

    "Digital scholars love doing dynamic things.While a text-under-constant-editing (or a data-collection) may be a valuable locus of scholarly activity, it is not yet a published scholarly work.Publish a text citable by CTS URN, and if you edit it later, publish a new version.This is one of the important benefits of CTS, which allows many versions to be aligned.[urn:cts:scholarship:lod.discussion:answer.2b]James Tauber: In terms of usage, I think it's worth considering not only the publishers of texts (and, as Chris points out, other citable data) but those consuming such texts or wanting to say something about those texts or passages within them. Source: The CITE Architecture: Q & A Regarding CTS and CITE. Thomas Koentges et al. ISAW Papers 20.8 (2021) ",
    "You don't need to be publishing new works to benefit from CTS.On the consumption side, one application of CTS is in building reading environments like the Scaife Digital Library Viewer.Canonical references can be used for retrieval of texts from a repository to read, as bookmarks, for reading lists, and so on.Another is in text-processing tools that ingest machine-actionable texts.Being able to retrieve texts and text passages via a uniform identifier can help improve the reproducibility of text-processing tasks because you can record the CTS URNs of the exact passages of a particular version you retrieved and others can repeat the same.

    "Since at the time the PDL assumed it would never be able to create TEI-XML editions for so many authors and works, it was decided to create an extensible and growing catalog, inspired by the FRBR entity relationship model.The major goal was to design a catalog that bridged the gap between the deep but narrow coverage of disciplinary bibliographies such as the TLG Canon and the much broader but necessarily shallower metadata found within library cataloging systems regarding classical editions.Disciplinary bibliographies such as the TLG Canon offered extensive coverage of many authors and works (including many that are fragmentary) that often did not have separate editions and were not always found in general library authority lists. Source: Linked Open Data for Greek and Latin Authors and Works. Babeu and Dilley. ISAW Papers 20.9 (2021)",
    "These bibliographies also served as checklists of editions but were not designed to represent the multiple editions of authors often found in online collections.Such bibliographies were also designed to cover closed collections not those that were available freely online.In addition, while library cataloging systems refer to multiple editions of the same work (as well as all types of related works such as commentaries, translations, derivative works, etc.), these relations are often unstated or only poorly formulated, and catalog records of necessity largely focused on books as a whole rather than on logical units within books (such as the hundreds of authors contained in the Greek Anthology).

    "Active work on metadata creation for the expanded Perseus Catalog thus began in 2006 and the main desiderata was to provide granular intellectual access (or analytical cataloging data so to speak) to individual works by classical authors at the online page level in these initial digitized editions, from single author-single work volumes to the massive five volume Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (containing hundreds of works).Main Standards Used in the Perseus CatalogThe Perseus Catalog design was greatly influenced by the IFLA FRBR standard, or Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records.46 FRBR is an entity-relationship model that was designed as a conceptual framework to help libraries create bibliographic records independent of any one set of cataloging rules. Source: Linked Open Data for Greek and Latin Authors and Works. Babeu and Dilley. ISAW Papers 20.9 (2021)",
    "The Perseus Catalog is often described internally as FRBR inspired rather than FRBR compliant because it does not follow all aspects of the FRBR model.Nonetheless, the FRBR model Group 1 entities, or works, expressions, manifestations, and items (sometimes known as WEMI) have been utilized by the catalog in terms of organizing its bibliographic data.While a work is defined as a distinct intellectual or artistic creation, an expression is the intellectual or artistic realization of that work, a manifestation physically embodies the expression of that work, and an item is a single copy of that manifestation.For example, Homer's Iliad is a work, a critical edition of that work by Thomas Allen is an expression, a publication of that edition in 1920 by Oxford Classical Texts (OCT) is a manifestation, and an individual library copy is an item, a single published version of a work.The Canonical Text Service Protocol (CTS)47 and its related CITE Architecture, both developed by the Homer Multitext project,48 are the other key standards that support the Perseus catalog data architecture. Source: Linked Open Data for Greek and Latin Authors and Works. Babeu and Dilley. ISAW Papers 20.9 (2021)",
    "The FRBR model has also influenced the CTS protocol albeit with some key differences.The CTS text hierarchy has defined a level called the textgroup that is above the work level because a definition was needed that could include traditional authors of literary texts but that could also encompass authorship groups such as entire corpus collections.These textgroups require unique identifiers.While works are defined in the same way as FRBR, expressions have been modeled as editionstranslations, a practice that the Perseus Catalog has also followed in terms of indicating particular published versions of works.The most important part of the CTS standard, in terms of the Perseus Catalog implementation, is that CTS supports a network service that can be used to identify and retrieve text fragments with canonical references that are expressed by CTS-URNs.

    "Within the catalog these CTS-URNs are used to serve as both version identifiers and canonical URIs for editions translations and they draw upon work identifiers from three classical canons: the TLG, the PHI, and STOA Consortium list of Latin authors.49 To return to our example of an edition above, Allen's 1920 edition of the Iliad published by the OCT, the CTS-URN for the Greek edition of this work available in the PDL would be urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-grc1.50 To explain, tlg0012 is the textgroup identifier for Homer (author 0012 in the TLG Canon), tlg001 is the TLG work identifier for the Iliad, and perseus-grc1 is the edition or version identifier.Perseus Catalog Bibliographic and Authority RecordsActive metadata creation began for the Perseus Catalog in 2006 and continues to the present day.

A design principle of Syriaca.org is to facilitate these existing lines of research while also creating a flexible data model that will not foreclose new directions of research.As already noted, the development of Syriac Studies has often been as an auxiliary part of larger fields of inquiry.

    "For example, two places might be mentioned in a medieval text as both being near a third place but without specificity.While this ambiguous relationship could be modelled somewhat generically in RDF, a historian will likely want to consult the original passage in the historical text for herself since the context may reveal something which cannot be easily encoded.Given these constraints, Syriaca.org needed a base data format better-suited to encoding and annotating historical source texts.This need prompted the project to look beyond the current usage of the Semantic Web for a data format which would allow the Syriaca.org data sets to reuse primary sources.

    "This search was undertaken in the spirit of Linked Data best practices which encourage the reuse of widely shared vocabularies.For the scholarly encoding and analysis of textual and historical data, such a widely-adopted set of terms exists, but it predates the Semantic web and thus is not an RDF vocabulary.This vocabulary is the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI).78 The TEI guidelines are a set of over 500 XML tags which have been curated and defined by a scholarly user community for more than two decades.79 Given the close fit of TEI Guidelines to Syriaca.org's textual data, our approach was to create a hybrid data model which could serialize the structures of Linked Data out of the textual mark-up of the TEI.

    "The resulting serialization stack uses RDF as an interchange format but retains TEI XML as the native data format.All data is authored in TEI XML and then serialized (e.g. generated) into RDF and HTML.The native use of TEI allows the Syriaca.org knowledge graph to document data provenance and cite sources following standard scholar practices of citation.An abbreviated example of this serialization is illustrated as Examples 3 and 4 and Figures 4 and 5 in the appendix.

    "Initially, these were the Duke Databank of Documentary Papyri (DDbDP), the Heidelberger Gesamtverzeichnis der griechischen Papyrusurkunden u00c4gyptens (HGV), and the Advanced Papyrological Information System (APIS).These databases were integrated in multiple rounds of development under the Integrating Digital Papyrology (IDP) projects (for more background on IDP and individual project history, see Bagnall 2010; Baumann 2013; Sosin 2010).As part of this integration process, the relationships between items in these and other databases needed to be mapped, in order that (for example) a transcription of text in the DDbDP could be associated with object and publication metadata in the HGV database, or image and curatorial metadata in APIS.

    "As part of the IDP development project, an automated mapping process was developed which ingests the various XML files from each database and outputs associations as Research Description Framework (RDF) triples, where each triple is a statement of the form subject-predicate-object (Cayless 2011; Cayless et al. 2012; Lanthaler, Wood, and Cyganiak 2014).So, to translate the earlier example into an RDF triple, a DDbDP transcription subject would have a relation predicate to an HGV publication metadata object.

    "The DDbDP, since its creation in 1982, has been focused on digital transcription and encoding of papyrological texts, starting from print editions (mostly confined to documentary texts, i.e. letters, tax records, and the things of everyday life, in contrast to literary texts which would encompass poetry and prose). HGV and APIS, meanwhile, collect metadata (place of origin, date, keywords, bibliography, etc.) and images of much of the same material.2Since the DDbDP's items and identifiers are distinguished at the level of text orprint edition, while HGV and APIS constitute themselves around the physical object, there can be complex, many-to-many relationships between these records. Source: Linked Open Data for Papyrology. Ryan Baumann. ISAW Papers 20.11 (2021)",
    "As a straightforward example, the rectoverso of a single piece of papyrus may bear two completely different texts by different people, and be represented as two texts in the DDbDP, associated with a single HGV record.It's also possible that a single text could be split across multiple papyrus fragments now held by multiple institutions.As we can see, these definitions of what constitutes a single papyrological object can vary depending on what your goal is. Source: Linked Open Data for Papyrology. Ryan Baumann. ISAW Papers 20.11 (2021)",
    "Papyri.info also links out to identifiers minted and held by Trismegistos (Depauw and Gheldof 2014), a database which focuses on collecting metadata about texts from antiquity and which has a similar object-based principle for papyri.These relationships are often one-to-one with HGV, but even here, reasonable disagreements about what constitutes a single object can arise, resulting in one-to-many relationships.

    "Another common scenario is that due to the DDbDP's original orientation around the print edition, multiple editions of a text (or at least, the identifiers for them) need to be related to one another, so that from a citation to an old edition of a text, the new edition can be discovered.Another artifact of the print world is the organization of multiple papyri into collections of papyri based on the print volume or series.

    "Introduction Accelerating and facilitating the adoption of the set of practices and technologies referred to as Linked Open Data presents a distinct opportunity for archaeological scholarship.Archaeology has long been defined by a publication tradition that due to the nature of fieldwork results in the presentation of features and finds in multiple small publications, and those publications are often segregated by material type and modern political boundaries irrelevant to the original contexts.

(Baker, 2014)Perhaps more importantly, even when a researcher does have either skill (or help) in structuring data, decisions about the structure of those data are certain to be driven by the specific concerns of the project at hand, and the preferences, skills and knowledge of the primary members of the research team.

    "The form, or at least permanent stone versions of it, likely originated in southern Italy in the early first century BCE.6 Initial spread was slow, and then from the mid-first century CE to the mid-second century many were built.As new amphitheaters appeared, older ones went out of use. A compelling pairing of growth and loss is the destruction of the amphitheater at Pompeii in 79 CE, an event that buried 20,000 seats in ash, and the opening shortly thereafter of the Flavian Amphitheater in Rome, the so-called Colosseum, which is in use by 80 CE.

I have tried to keep the code relatively simple so that the implementation is straightforward, readable, and ready for adaptation in other contexts.Looking at the output of this notebook, the initial settings mean that all amphitheaters are included in the histogram, which in turn indicates that the Flavian Amphitheater is very much an outlier in terms of capacity, so much so that it is represented by the single isolated bar at the right.

    "In the setting of a game, Reinhard explains, these tropes are a necessity in order to create via uncomplicated, visual language the simplest idea of what archaeology is.3 But that idea is itself distilled through decades of pop-cultural mediation of the definition and meaning of archaeology.In many games, archaeology and ancient locations and artifacts are used to communicate a sense of mystery or strangeness.

    "Very often, archaeology becomes a nexus for the paranormal, as in games that incorporate Atlantis like Atlantis Rising (2012), the gamebook Time Machine 8 Mystery of Atlantis (1985), and Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis (1992), to name just a few.Others, like the excavation-based game Scarabya (2018), casually blend landscapes comparable to Egypt and Mesoamerica with both Atlantis and an arctic site suggestive of the works of Lovecraft. (Despite this, Scarabyas puzzle mechanic resembles trench excavation, thus making it, in one respect, a rather clever gamification of actual archaeological practice.) This sort of imaginary antiquity is also present in games like Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild (2017), in which elfin adventurer Link is a sort of archaeologist as well, exploring ancient shrines and collecting pieces of forgotten technology.Anthropologist Jeb Card places this trend of blending the ancient and the mystical in the center of the landscape of what he calls spooky archaeology.

    "We have a responsibility to ensure that, in representing cultures of both the past and present, we are not modeling colonization and control.Faidutti is aware of this problem, if a bit glibly dismissive of it.He notes that there is something if not reactionary, at least romantic or backward looking in board game themes.9 Moreover, he grants that the graphic design of many board games, including his own, reflects a plain orientalist exoticism, of a kind that has disappeared from literature, movies and even comics.10 Faidutti seems to be thoroughly on the ludological side of the debate, arguing that games are not scholarly works.

    "Theme matters, but play matters too.In his recent book Digital Games as History, Adam Chapman cautions against an overemphasis on games providing the right version of history We cannot simply expect digital historical games to always function in alignment with narratives constructed in other forms, because they operate differently and therefore represent the past and offer engagements with history according to their own rules of engagement.15 He urges instead for an exploration of a games u2018historioludicity u2013 the representation of history and our thought about itu2026 through rules and opportunities for action and thus, ludic discourse.16 Or, as Andrew Elliott and Matthew Kapell put it, it is less interesting to note where and whether a given product deviates from the historical record, but rather for what reason it does so and what effect this might have.17 Of course, this assumes that game designers have approached the question of history with care and attention, and that they have reasons for deviating from what we know about the past.

A cartographer applies their judgement in this process of abstraction and thus translates that information about the world into a map.The kind of map that is produced and the kind of information it conveys reveal some of the priorities and judgements of the maps creator and the cultural forces of their society.

    "In each case, that abstraction of space has a relationship to the games victory conditions and involve considerable limitations on realistic geographical interactions.Because of this, each game makes historical arguments about the relationship between space and power.10 Both the map and the victory conditions abstract extremely complex systems in geographical and political space into player-comprehensible representations.

    "However, while each such choice was deliberate, it may not have been made with the goal of making a specific historical argument.At a certain point, any game designer will have to abstract their subject to a level that produces the kind of play experience they want to achieve.These choices about the level of abstraction condition the processes that occur during a given game as well as the goals that players strive towards.

    "Game designers will often look at these aspects of a game in reverse, asking how do I write the rules of this game to encourage players to act in a certain way during play.For example, designers concerned with the historical authenticity of their games, will often consider how they can design their rules to create historical outcomes or whether the game is sufficiently accurate for their taste.For historians engaged in what we might call scholarly design, it is important to examine also the historicity of the processes of abstraction themselves what aspects of the historical source material were selected, which aspects were omitted, what arguments do those acts of abstraction make about the historical world that this represented, and so on.While we might imagine that every designer of a historical game examines historical processes and applies processes of abstraction to derive the processes of play for a game, the scholar designer should be attentive to the relationship between abstraction and historical argument and consider the historical arguments that their choices bring to the game at each step.This is where the pain comes in.Abstracting HomerThe act of abstracting a set of source material and transferring it into another medium is an act of translation.

A board-game-as-simulation removes the impartial computational referee, and forces the players to interpret, understand, and contest the formalization recorded in the rules of the game.

A lack of diverse representations of past peoples in board games can have a negative impact on players by reinforcing narratives that cast men as the sole socio-political and economic actors in the past (Beavers 2020, 7).

    "This course was designed specifically to appeal to business-oriented undergraduates who wish to satisfy their pre-modern distributional requirement with a course that speaks to their interests in business and finance.The subject matter (i.e., law and economics) lends itself naturally to teaching via games, but all the more so when it comes to Classical Greece, since its agonistic culture prompted many communities to organize their political, legal, economic, and fiscal institutions quite explicitly as contests.1 Plato decried this predilection in his critique of Athenian democracy (e.g., Resp.

    "This fundamental alienation often effectively prevents students from entering into the properly imaginative world of historical analysis and critical engagement with primary evidence.Games, as Abt argued a half century ago, are the perfect device for structuring critical engagement through problem-based learning they are fun, cheap, harness our competitive natures, encourage interaction between students, and prompt second-order thinking and deep learning, i.e., not passively knowing basic facts or primary evidence, but doing something synthetic with the material.6It is in this last connection that we should draw a distinction between what we are here calling serious games, which are problem-based simulations, and gamification.7 By gamification I mean game experiences whereinthe game structure is essentially independent of the occasion for playing and the subject matter of the lesson or course;the game design, mechanisms, and tactics respond first and foremost to the social and physical dimensions of the class and the classroom, not the subject matter;competition typically revolves around demonstrating traditional mastery of subject matter;cooperation is typically restricted to within teams, as opposed to between teamswinning is typically signaled by a notionally impartial umpire, and any rewards are often awarded by the same non-player authority and are themselsource: Agoranomika Playful approaches to teaching the serious economic and institutional history of measurement in the ancient Greek world.

    "This almost Hegelian antithesis inherent in the structure of historically serious games proceeds from a theory of human nature implicit in practice of history itself, namely that human nature is sufficiently stable to allow us to understand and interpret the actions of people who lived in places, times, and political, social, and cultural milieux far different from our own.As Arnaldo Momigliano once said, the reason we study change is that we are changeable;11 however, to recognize and give meaning to change we must practice a historicism grounded in a certain set of universal human drives and propensities.12I conclude with these reflections because they have important implications for what the students who play my game, or any ancient simulation, learn.

    "Instead, we should understand students playing serious historical games in class as engaging in an exercise very like what their classmates do in a scientific laboratory.So, when chemistry students experiment with air columns, pumps, and pressure valves to confirm Boyles Constant, they learn something about the physical properties of gasses and the mechanics and methods of experimentation.If the experiment fails, they know to repeat it what failed was their method, not physics.

(1) They learn about some of the fundamental, ineluctable problems and costs associated with measurement, the manifestations of and responses to which are conditioned by the historical intersection of the physical properties of goods, technological capabilities or constraints, the economic value of goods, informal (i.e., norms) and formal (i.e., laws) modes of regulation, and political power.

    "This in turn requires that students not only become comfortable with legal and economic analysis, but also build over the term a basic cultural competency with respect to ancient Greek social structures, norms, and preferences, so that they begin to understand (in Douglass Norths metaphor) the rules of the game as it was played in Classical Greece, including some of the Greeks go-to strategies and tactics in economic life.16 The course is divided into thematic units, which progressively introduce the interconnected evolution and development of various institutions and related developments over this extended period, particularly, but not exclusively, in Athens, such as poleis and oikoi (households), markets, courts, democracy, literacy, coinage, and banking.

    "Departing from this analogy, however, is the fact that the tasks necessarily involve cooperation and competition between teams for resources, and so teams will often cognize the successful completion of a transaction as beating other teams, not only those teams that might have failed to conclude a trade, but also (and interestingly) the teams that were on the other side of their successful deal.This is to say, that in my experience, the students have naturally responded to core tasks of the various phases as if they were playing a game to win.Phase 1 Prices and measuresEach polisoikos begins with three containers or silos with unequal amounts of rice, red beans, and red or green lentils.

    "Indeed, it is often the student who asks whether or not we can weigh the rice who starts the discussion of quality, since the act of weighing tends to draw attention to the purity of the good being weighed as one watches it be poured out, as opposed to filling a certain volume, where the perceptual and intellectual focus is squarely on the limit of the container.In order to weigh the goods, I introduce the simple balance I made (figs. 4u20135).29 Now students have a second way of measuring goods they may use the scale to set a standard unit volume, which will also have an equivalent standard weight.

    "This is useful, and the students typically move quickly to weighing the goods, since it is easier to be precise about multiples and fractions (i.e., one can easily counterbalance against half a cup of rice or two cups of rice).Using rice as a counterweight is obviously cumbersome, and inevitably involves waste in the form of spillage.30 More than one class has come up with the idea of using counterweights, which are far more convenient and never result in waste; and all have been quick to adopt them when I suggest that they experiment with some that I provide (fig. 3).

    "Because there are no parallel great circles in spherical geometry, the natural interpretation is that, because the lines he indicates are so short, they can be seen as two straight lines on a plane.So, to analyze that case, I will assume this, and determine the angle at which both lines will intersect in order to determine how close they were to being parallel.The method I used to do that is described in Appendix 1.2b08#p11The rest of the configurations offer no special difficulties in order to analyze the isosceles triangle I simply compare the distances between the apex and the two stars at the base, using the formula given in (Meeus, 1998 109). source: A study on the stellar configurations in Almagest VII 1.

    "Thus, the relative immobility would only apply within the set of zodiacal stars on the one hand, and within the set of extra zodiacal stars on the other, but not to sets of stars comprised of the two kinds.It is clear that Ptolemy does not hold this position, but instead had understood that all the stars undergo the rearward motion (i.e., a motion in the direction of increasing longitude), and thus that all their relative positions remain unchanged. source: A study on the stellar configurations in Almagest VII 1.

    "It may be that this variation has no special meaning.However, a possible reason for Hipparchus to put the origin of the list in the summer point rather that in the vernal point may lie in the fact that he used the Kallippic Cycle14 as the main reference for dating astronomical observations.Now, the First Kallippic Cycle began with the summer solstice of -329, so this may be an indication that his epoch had, at least in this respect, a greater significance.2b08#p139In my study of the Hipparchian configurations I have noted the zodiacal or extra-zodiacal nature of the stars that determine them. source: A study on the stellar configurations in Almagest VII 1.

    "As Evans suggests (Evans, 1998 259) it may very well be the case that Hipparchus discovery of precession came while developing his lunar model.In fact, Ptolemy says (Toomer, 1984 327) that Hipparchus used, as a reference for comparison, the longitude of Spica Timocharis had obtained during a lunar eclipse.Even if Timocharis had used the distance between Spica and the moon as a way of determining the position of the moon, Hipparchus could reverse the method. source: A study on the stellar configurations in Almagest VII 1.

    "Given that he had an accurate solar model, he could determine the position of the moon independently, and thus obtain the longitude of Spica at the time of Timocharis.Because the previous reference for stellar positions was the moon, Hipparchus must not have had many positions of extra-zodiacal stars which he could use to check the extent of the precession phenomenon.Thus, his research on this question must have been tentative.2b08#p140However, when we look at the list of configurations Ptolemy preserved in the Almagest, we can see that Ptolemys suggestion that Hipparchus ended up concluding that precession was universal was certainly grounded in Hipparchus research. source: A study on the stellar configurations in Almagest VII 1.

    "Out of the 24 sets of stars15 he uses in the configurations that have come down to us, 14 are of a mixed nature.The rest are equally divided 5 are sets of all extra-zodiacal stars, and 5 are sets of all zodiacal ones.In fact, almost 6 out of 10 of the stars the configurations refer to had a latitude greater than 00b1 1000b0.If Ptolemys is a list which is representative of the original work, then it seems that Hipparchus made sure to cover all the possibilities in his research.2b08#p141But, as we saw, Ptolemys role is not limited to recounting some of his predecessors configurations, and checking them in his own times. source: A study on the stellar configurations in Almagest VII 1.

    "In a bold move, Ptolemy recognizes the possibility that proper stellar motion may be so slow that even the period between himself and Hipparchus is not enough to detect a variation in their relative positions.His list of configurations is thus given as supplementary material for future astronomers to check this feature.One the one hand, this shows us a rather modern approach on Ptolemys part.On the other, we should not overestimate the importance of this addendum, because Ptolemy had shown that, if the fixed stars were in fact not fixed and had a proper motion, the speed of this motion was so slow that it would not affect the accuracy of his planetary models. source: A study on the stellar configurations in Almagest VII 1.

    "The Anthologies of Vettius Valens is the most extensive practical astrological text which survives from Greek antiquity.2 The Anthologies consists of nine books, which include a huge quantity of information on astrological methods as well as catalogues of predictions.In total, the Anthologies contains around 130 partial or complete horoscopes ranging from 37-188 CE, some of which are used multiple times.3 These horoscopes suggest that the majority of the work was written between 152 and 162 CE, and the Anthologies has been in almost constant use since.4 As a resource for 2018literary horoscopes (i.e. those not from an original text, such as papyri) it is unparalleled Neugebauer and Van Hoesen noted there would only be five other extant literary horoscopes dating from before 380 CE if the Anthologies had not survived. 5 Although we have little external biographical information about Vettius Valens, one of these horoscopes was suggested by Pingree to be that of Valens himself.6 From this horoscope and the associated details Valens provides, we can infer that he was born on 8 February 120 CE in Antioch, travelled widely, including to Egypt, and spent the majority of his working life as an astrologer in Alexandria.72b08#p1Valens is often contrasted with his near-contemporary Ptolemy (c.1002013c.170 CE), also associated with Alexandria.

    "In brief, the twelve signs of the zodiac can be represented in hexadecimal notation.47 The current zodiacal sign of each the seven planets (in the order Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon)48 can then be converted into a digit in hexadecimal notation, so a configuration of planets can be represented as a seven-digit code.We follow Boxer in referring to this as a Z-code (from 2018Zodiac-code).49 For example, the Z-code2b08#p25AA1A9A0means that Saturn is in Aquarius (A), Jupiter in Aquarius (A), Mars in Taurus (1), the Sun in Aquarius (A), Venus in Capricorn (9), Mercury in Aquarius (A), and the Moon in Aries (0). Z-codes offer a convenient way to simplify historical astronomical data to investigate the planetary combinations realised within the resulting horoscopes.50 This is appropriate for Valens, since he usually quotes only the zodiacal signs for each planet.512b08#p26We used Flatlib, a Python 3 library for traditional astrology52 in conjunction with the Swiss Ephemeris to calculate the Z-code for each day in Valens century and the century before, from 1st January 1 CE to 31st December 200 CE, taking midday on each day.

A typical horoscope might include aspectual combinations of four, five, or even six or seven planets; even if there appear to be some different u2018nodes in the aspect network, it is extremely common for all of the planets to fit into a single linked network through a set of aspectual relationships.

    "Nevertheless, because the varying width of the Milky Way spans several degrees on both sides of the galactic equator, the visibility of the entire galactic equator does not assure that the Milky Way itself will be wholly observable in all its details, particularly some sections near its rims.As we saw, Ptolemy would have been able to see up to about 37.500b0 - 3100b0 = 600b0 to the south of the southernmost point of the galactic equator.

    "There is, nevertheless, a pattern of deviation from this general value.As the belt gets closer to the center, Ptolemy tends to diminish its width to Pannekoeks value of 30 and even 40.This may have something to do with the fact that there is a high contrast between the very bright clouds in Sagittarius, and the dark clouds which are intertwined with them.Also, it is possible that the low altitude this area had as seen from Alexandria at the time, with the high effect that extinction had because of this, tended to lower the apparent brightness of the region.

    "The PAS is a government funded project in the United Kingdom, which promotes the voluntary recording of archaeological objects found by members of the public in England and Wales and administers the Treasure Act process.These objects that are recorded on the PAS database range from the Prehistoric to Post-Medieval periods (as defined in the UK by English Heritage) with a large corpus of material that can be attributed to the Roman Empire, of which the majority are coins. Source: Linking Portable Antiquities to a Wider Web",
    "Indeed, numismatic material provides the greatest opportunity for the Scheme to link to other resources (or URIs) through their regular attributes such as the mint (geography), era (time), issuer or moneyer (people), place of discovery (geography) and so on.#p1Since 2003 (Pett 2010a) these data have been placed online within a dynamic database that is updated in real-time, and over 900,000 objects have been recorded with images and extensive metadata (over 200 possible fields, many using controlled and agreed vocabularies) being collected for each. Source: Linking Portable Antiquities to a Wider Web",
    "These metadata present an exciting and very practical opportunity for implementing linked data techniques, collaborating with many of the attending projects, and this paper will briefly touch on this.#p2The majority of attending projects were beginning their adventure into the world of Linked and Open Data (LOD) and many could provide data that the PAS software could and can consume and use for enrichment of its own website (Pett 2010b, Gruber et al. 2012). Source: Linking Portable Antiquities to a Wider Web",
    "In turn these linkages can be tied to external resources such as Virtual Identity Authorities Files (VIAF) or dbPedia or as Kansa (2013) showed in his excellent presentations, to projects such as the Encyclopaedia of Life.#p3Pre-LAWDI: where did the PAS website stand?The PAS software is written entirely by the paper's author (all source code available at GitHub), and builds on the original content management system that was provided by Oxford ArchDigital before their liquidation in 2007 (Pett 2010a). (Like Kansa's superb OpenContext, choices of technology and implementation are very similar: PHP, Solr etc). (This software provides a platform for the 'real-time' capture and publication of artefacts discovered by the public within England and Wales, whilst pursuing their hobbies.) From this period onwards, the author began to explore best practices for web implementation and early on in the development of the site (Pett 2012); a decision was made to begin the journey towards what was to become Berners-Lees 5 stars of linked data (see Berners-Lee 2006 and Hausenblas 2010) with the implementation of cool URIs (W3C 2008) which attempted to describe the resource that the consumer would find; for example: http://finds.org.uk/romancoins/personifications/named/as/Apollo which leads to details of the page within the Roman coin guide describing the depiction of the personification of Apollo.

    "Data driven pages within the site could be obtained in various representations - for example as JSON, XML, CSV or KML u2013 but content negotiation was still lacking and is at the present time as the author has not managed to find time to implement this.The lack of finds.org.uk serving up data with content negotiation has been highlighted by Light (2011) and is something that does need resolving.#p4Within the site templates structured data has been used for example microformats (these are now 7 years old as a concept) and rdfa (Herman et al, 2013) are used extensively.

    "For example within HTML contact templates, FOAF standards were implemented (Brickley and Miller 2010).This can be shown in Googles webmaster tools structured data section in figure 1 below:#p5Post-LAWDI 2012After the 2012 event at ISAW (Elliot et al. 2012), efforts were made to bring the PAS into the Pelagios family.This was quite a simple task to expedite with expert advice available online (Barker, Isaksen and Simon 2012) and the PAS database already using Pleiades identifiers within its schema. A weekly compiled dump of the ever changing PAS data that had Pleiades IDs (Pett, 2012b) was produced and this was integrated into the Pelagios ecosystem (at present over 80,000 Roman coins records on the PAS database have attributions to Roman mints which have been aligned with Pleiades identifiers, leaving around 90,000 unattributed.) These data were used to great effect in Cayless data explorer visualisation that was unveiled to the world at large at LAWDI-2013 (Cayless 2013) with Rome being our highest attribution.#p6In the spirit of collaboration and as a mutual benefit, the PAS also hosted a mirror tile store of the maps that Johan u00c5hfeldt (2012) created and these are available for anyone to use, with the PAS picking up the associated bandwidth costs (Pett 2012d). Source: Linking Portable Antiquities to a Wider Web",
    "Further integration with LAWDI resources included the use of the Pelagios widget, Nomisma and Pleiades identifiers and the ISAW javascript library (Rabinowitz & Heath 2012).#p7Attempts were also made to implement more structured data within HTML templates, for example the use of Schema.org and Facebooks OpenGraph metadata tags. A good example of structured data in action can be seen through the authors implementation of Twitter cards (Pett 2012), a pretty simple process where meta-tags are added to the head section of an HTML document and this allows the Twitter user-interfaces to parse a concise preview of your content (figure 2 below demonstrates this for the Roman cavalry helmet found with an Iron Age hoard in Leicestershire u2013 PAS record PAS-984616 - (Leins & Hill 2012).#p8Concerted efforts were also made to try and bring the authority lists used for recording coins to external authority lists, and to achieve this, the author used OpenRefine to reconcile terms against VIAF (see Page 2013 for details on how to do this) and dbPedia. Source: Linking Portable Antiquities to a Wider Web",
    "Some of the results of this can be seen in Elliots About Roman Emperors project (2013) and also within the templates used in the PAS website numismatic guides and this process of enhancement is ongoing.#p9Post LAWDI 2013 u2013 production and consumption of linked data.Following the 2013 event at Drew University, the author began to embark on further development of the LOD capabilities of the PAS website (Pett 2013). A decision was made to integrate with resources provided by English Heritage, the Ordnance Survey, Nomisma, VIAF, dbPedia and the British Museum in a more regimented fashion throughout the records of objects held within the database.#p10Production of linked data via the PAS websiteRDF is now produced by using XSLT on XML returned from the SOLR indexes that drive the search engine that power PAS pages and this RDF would attempt to be modelled in the same manner as the British Museum's representation of the CIDOC-CRM model (also building on previous work conducted by the University of Vienna as part of the European funded BRICKS project (Nussbaumer and Haslhofer, 2007: 7u201318) but with links out to the resources described above.

    "Through personal correspondence, and face to face meetings with the Research Space project team and via detailed consultation of their draft mapping document (Oldman et al 2013), an attempted modelling has been produced (yet to be documented).The author has changed/ignored some aspects and adopted the nested RDFXML (Klyne 2010) that has been used by the Claros project at Oxford University and also linked to external resources (something that the British Museum implementation does not do yet.)#p11Integration with the British Museum thesauri was reasonably complicated, but was managed through querying their development endpoint and exporting results as CSV. Source: Linking Portable Antiquities to a Wider Web",
    "The resulting tables are now available on GitHub and these were imported into our MySQL database for querying and joining with our existing thesauri.The same process was implemented on the AHRC funded Seneschal endpoint ( to obtain their URI structures, and these were also imported and linked to the PAS schema.These identifiers can then be compiled within the RDF that is ultimately produced from the PAS site, alongside the already integrated Nomisma and Pleiades identifiers. Source: Linking Portable Antiquities to a Wider Web",
    "Linking to these mentioned resources provides a rich foundation on which to build either within the confines of the PAS website or on third party sites.#p12As the PAS database is updated in real-time, there are multiple changes daily to the dataset and our RDF is regenerated nightly through a scheduled cronjob calling a script that transforms the SOLR XML and saves it to our server (http://finds.org.uk/rdf/ provides a list of available files as {date}.rdf or pelagios-{date}.rdf) and also to Amazon S3 for archiving purposes (15 days saved on an incremental basis.)#p13Consumption of linked data within the PAS websiteWith the integration of external identifiers into the PAS database schema, the enrichment of resources can be much improved. Source: Linking Portable Antiquities to a Wider Web",
    "Prior to LAWDI-2012, the author had integrated data from various resources, usually via the use of Applications Programming Interfaces (APIs), but sometimes via consumption of RDF data.This was achieved by the use of the ARC2 library (Nowak 2011), but this has now been superseded by using the EasyRDF PHP library (Humfrey 2012) and has led to a wider consumption of RDF throughout the site.It is now possible to extract more data for the enrichment of our issuer and ruler biographical pages, for example Augustus, where via the use of identifiers drawn from Nomisma, the British Museum and dbPedia an aggregated biographical page can be produced and presented with dynamic data drawn directly from the PAS database. Source: Linking Portable Antiquities to a Wider Web",
    "This principle has also been applied to the coin guides for other periods of British history, with the same enriching effect.Extra information can be gleaned from the structured data returned from dbPedia, with information relating to parents, titles, battle commands and wives readily available.The return on investment and time spent tying these identifiers to our vocabulary and authority lists is therefore apparent!source: Linking Portable Antiquities to a Wider Web",
    "Other examples are also easy to find within the PAS website, for instance, by combining Pleiades and Nomisma identifiers, enriched pages relating to Roman mints can be produced, (for example, see Rome) with images obtained from Flickr when they have been machine tagged appropriately (see Gillies 2012.) Data can also be consumed from the excellent Pelagios project, as shown below in figure 3:#p14One caveat that the PAS website has shown to ingesting these data is the reliance on uptime of the other resources u2013 dbPedia is frequently slow or down and this can have, and Pleiades has a period of instability which have significant impact on enriched resources.#p15Where does the road lead now?source: Linking Portable Antiquities to a Wider Web",
    "Following on from LAWDI 2012 and 2013, it is intended to develop the LOD capabilities of the PAS further.Work is presently underway to enable a SPARQL endpoint to a self-hosted triple store through a choice of software currently being evaluated: Apache Marmotta and Fuseki (which has been used to good effect by Gruber (2013)) which is hoped will allow PAS data to be used in more applications within the LAWDI family.

    "Beyond this initial audience, there is also the possibility of feeding into the Mellon funded Research Space initiative and to provide data for other LOD projects.#p16It is also hoped that it will be possible to modify the Zend Framework based PAS system to allow for full content negotiation and ideally, removal of the u2018Share-Alike Creative Commons licence and replacement with a simple CC-BY version Work will also continue to increase the amount of structured data available via the xhtml+rdfa pages of the website and database and further resources to link to will be sought out and partnerships forged.

    "With good fortune and some extra human resources in the offing, it is hoped that the PAS might reach the 5 stars level by quarter one of 2014.Funding has been forthcoming from the Arts and Humanites Research Council (AHRC) for two projects that will deal with the production and consumption of linked data - one project (looking at crowd-sourcing, crowd-funding and 3D visualisation) with UCL (u00a3318,000) and a visualisation project with Tracemedia (u00a35,000).

    "The extant portion of the verso side of the Muziris papyrus (PVindob G 40822 v = SB XVIII 13617 v) contains the monetary evaluation of three-quarters of an Indian cargo loaded on the ship Hermapollon.Among the commodities are 167 elephant tusks weighing 3,228.5 kgs and schidai weighing 538.5 kgs.It is argued that schidai are fragments of tusks trimmed away from captive elephants. A comparison with commercial ivory lots of the early sixteenth century shows the selected quality of the tusks loaded on the Hermapollon.#abstractSubjects: India--Relations--Rome, Ivory industry, Economic history--to 500.

    "IntroductionThe texts on the Papyrus Vindobonensis G 40822,1 now widely known as the Muziris papyrus, will be remembered as among the most significant pieces of evidence related to Indo-Roman trade published in the twentieth century, and the more we understand them, the more important they become.The extant portion of the text on the verso contains the monetary evaluation of three-quarters of the South Indian cargo loaded on the ship Hermapollon (probably at Muziris, mentioned in the text on the recto), and two recent papers, one by Federico Morelli and the other by me, have proposed an almost complete reconstruction of the evaluated commodities. Source: Federico De Romanis (2014). Ivory from Muziris. ISAW Papers, 8.",
    "Both papers emphasized, albeit in very different measures, the predominant share of pepper and malabathron in the cargo, the two main exports from the Limyrike emporia.2 Both Morelli and I came to recognize that the 771 money talents and 4,632 drachmae recorded at col. i, ll. 25-263 are the value of (almost) three-quarters of the pepper cargo, but while Morelli suggests that that value resulted from a price of 24 drachmae per mina, I contend that a price of 6 drachmae per mina is the only price that can account for the position of other numerical values in the text. Source: Federico De Romanis (2014). Ivory from Muziris. ISAW Papers, 8.",
    "Moreover, both Morelli and I interpret the weight number at col. i, l. 18 as the weight of three-quarters of the malabathron cargo, but while he reads the first two digits as 1,200 and assumes a price of 20 drachmae per mina, I read them as 1,800 and deduce a price of 12 drachmae per mina.Finally, I assume that the Hermapollons cargo included another commodity, evaluated at col. i, ll. 14-16, which might have been tortoise shell. Source: Federico De Romanis (2014). Ivory from Muziris. ISAW Papers, 8.",
    "In this paper I would like to focus on two other commodities exported on the Hermapollon: the sound ivory tusks and the schidai.As the meaning of the Greek term schidai in the papyrus is disputed, it makes better sense to analyze the two commodities in reverse order of their appearance in the document.Therefore, we shall start with the schidai and later consider the sound ivory.#p1Schidai, ivory of lower value. Source: Federico De Romanis (2014). Ivory from Muziris. ISAW Papers, 8.",
    "As we shall see, schidai represent less than 1% of the entire value of the Hermapollons cargo, and their weight was little more than half a ton.Yet a correct understanding of this entry will have a significant impact on the general interpretation of the text, and may shed some light both on the Cu0113ra kingdom to which the ancient Muziris belonged and on the ivory trade on the ancient Indian Ocean.#p2In the papyrological documents, the Greek term u03c3u03c7u03afu03b4u03b1u03b9 (schidai) occurs only on the verso of the Muziris papyrus col. ii, ll. 16 and 25. Source: Federico De Romanis (2014). Ivory from Muziris. ISAW Papers, 8.",
    "In that portion of the textu2014col. ii, ll. 16-25u2014the value of three-quarters of the schidai brought back by the Hermapollon is calculated.The evaluation follows the complex pattern by which the three-quarters of sound ivory is assessed at col. ii, ll. 4-15.From the weight number representing the three-quarters (13 weight talents and 9.75 minae), a small parcel (22.75 minae), which is said to be taken in addition by the arabarchs4 for the tetartologia, is removed. Source: Federico De Romanis (2014). Ivory from Muziris. ISAW Papers, 8.",
    "The rest (12 weight talents and 47 minae) is converted twice, first into Roman pounds at the ratio of 1 Egyptian talent to 95 Roman pounds, and then back into Egyptian talents at the ratio of 97.5 Roman pounds : 1 Egyptian talent.The resulting weight number (12 weight talents and 27 minae), at the price of 70 drachmae per mina, leads to a value of 8 money talents and 4,290 drachmae.Then the 22.75 minae that had been taken in addition by the arabarchs for the tetartologia are multiplied for the same price of 70 drachmae per mina: the result is 1,592.5 drachmae. Source: Federico De Romanis (2014). Ivory from Muziris. ISAW Papers, 8.",
    "By adding the two subtotals, a value of 8 money talents and 5,882.5 drachmae is obtained.#p3As Rathbone first understood and Morelli now confirms, 13 weight talents and 9.75 minae are just three-quarters of the schidai exported on the Hermapollon.The entire quantity was the weight number recorded at col. i, l. 10, that is, 17 weight talents and 33 minae, from which one quarter (4 weight talents and 23.25 minae) was removed.#p4Since the talent referred to here is equivalent to 95 Roman pounds, the schidai weighed around 538.5 kgs.

    "But what exactly is a schida?Drawing on Hesychius entry <u03c3u03c7u03afu03b4u03b1>u0387 u03c3u03c7u03afu03b4u03bfu03c2 u03c3u03b9u03bdu03b4u03ccu03bdu03bfu03c2, u03c0u1fc6u03b3u03bcu03b1 (schida: division of a garment, fabric),5 Harrauer and Sijpesteijn, the first editors of the papyrus, understood the term as referring to a detached piece of a larger whole u03c3u03b9u03bdu03b4u03ceu03bd, a bale of cloth.6 Although neither u03c3u03c7u03afu03b4u03b1u03b9 nor u03c3u03b9u03bdu03b4u03ccu03bdu03b5u03c2 (cloths, garments) are mentioned in the Periplus Maris Erythraei as Limyrike commodities,7 Harrauer and Sijpesteijn pointed out that the Periplus Maris Erythraei does mention u03c3u03b9u03bdu03b4u03ccu03bdu03b5u03c2 among the exports from the Ganges emporion,8 and that Gangetic nard, another typical Ganges commodity9 imported by the Hermapollon,10 also appears among the commodities available in the Limyrike emporia.11 The implicit suggestion was that both Gangetic nard and excellent Gangetic garments were exported from the Ganges emporion to Muziris and from there re-exported to Egypt.#p5Harrauer and Sijpesteijn considered thesource: Federico De Romanis (2014).

    "possibility that in Vindob. G 40822 verso col. ii, ll. 16; 25 u03c3u03c7u03b9u03b4u1ff6u03bd could be a misspelling for u03c3u03c7u03b9u03b6u1ff6u03bd,12 but they rejected the idea that it could have meant Holzscheit.13 They also rejected a connection with Hesychius lemma u03c3u03c7u03afu03b4u03b9u03b1u0387 u1f60u03bcu03ccu03bbu03b9u03bdu03b1, on the grounds that raw Flax (u1f60u03bcu03ccu03bbu03b9u03bdu03b1), a typical Egyptian product, is unlikely to appear among the imports from India.14#p6The interpretations of Harrauer and Sijpesteijn, basically accepted or unquestioned by subsequent scholars,15 were challenged by Rathbone. Source: Federico De Romanis (2014). Ivory from Muziris. ISAW Papers, 8.",
    "Considering u03c3u03c7u03afu03b4u03b1 as only a variant of u03c3u03c7u03afu03b6u03b1 (piece of wood cut off, lath, splinter), Rathbone suggested that the schidai were fragments of elephant tusks and thus distinct from the sound ivory (u1f10u03bbu03adu03c6u03b1u03c2 u1f51u03b3u03b9u03aeu03c2) mentioned at col. ii, l. 4 of the same text, which were entire tusks.16 Rathbone buttressed his interpretation observing 1) that the u03bcu1f73u03bd at col. ii, l. 4 and a u03b4u1f73 to be read at col. ii, l. 1617 structured the phrase so as to contrast the sound ivory and the schidai;18 and 2) that the value of the unspecified ivory (u1f10u03bbu03adu03c6u03b1u03c2), lost with the lacuna at col. ii, l. 26, must have merged the value of the sound ivory with that of the schidai. Source: Federico De Romanis (2014). Ivory from Muziris. ISAW Papers, 8.",
    "To me, Rathbones argument seems decisive on this point: if schidai were not ivory, the u03bcu1f73u03bd at col. ii, l. 4, would be a strange u03bcu1f73u03bd solitarium; and if schidai were not ivory, then we could not explainu2014except as a clerical erroru2014why the clerk records again the value of an unspecified ivory, after having already calculated the value of the schidai.Reasonable as it seemed at the time, the interpretation of the first editors does not accord as well with the context as does Rathbones reading.#p7Fragments or imperfect tusks?source: Federico De Romanis (2014). Ivory from Muziris. ISAW Papers, 8.",
    "That said, the sense of the contrast between sound ivory and schidai still remains to be properly understood.The difference of price between sound ivory (100 drachmae per mina) and schidai (70 drachmae per mina) makes it clear that schidai were ivory of secondary quality.However, was their quality secondary because they were accidental fragments rather than sawn pieces of ivory, as Rathbone assumed?source: Federico De Romanis (2014). Ivory from Muziris. ISAW Papers, 8.",
    "The question is far from trifling, not least because it is pivotal for determining the nature of the arabarchs share.#p8According to Rathbone, the evaluation preserved in the papyrus concerns only three-quarters of the Hermapollons cargo because one-quarter of the commodities would have been removed to pay the quarter-tax in kind.Consistently, the rationale of the share taken in addition by the arabarchs for the quarter-tax is seen as a way to simplify the practical division of sound ivory and schidai, two commodities from which an exact weight was not easy to extract.19 In other words, since it was impossible for the arabarchs to take exactly 25% of the ivory weights without sawing the tusks or the fragments (and thereby damaging the commodity), they took a little more than 25%: 11.75 minae (around 6 kgs), in the case of sound ivory; as much as 22.75 minae (around 11.6 kgs), in the case of the schidai.#p9The contradiction inherent in Rathbones argument was understood by Morelli, who follows Rathbone in assuming that the quarter-tax was paid in kind and that the function of the shares taken in addition by the arabarchs was to ease the payment in kind of the quarter-tax of commodities such as ivory tusks and schidai.20 Precisely for that reason, however, Morelli is reluctant to accept Rathbones conclusion that schidai were accidental fragments of tusks. Source: Federico De Romanis (2014). Ivory from Muziris. ISAW Papers, 8.",
    "His implicit reasoning is clear: if the 22.75 minae (= 11.6 kgs) taken in addition by the arabarchs are only a fraction of the weight of the smallest schida of the lot, the Greek term cannot refer to tusk fragments, but must refer rather to entire tusks that were imperfect in some wayu2014spoiled or cracked or only slightly broken.In other words, the schidai were in fact whole tusks, but not sound.21#p10There is very little doubt that the entry of sound ivory (u1f10u03bbu03adu03c6u03b1u03c2 u1f51u03b3u03b9u03aeu03c2) refers to entire tusks: at col. ii, ll. 12 and 13 the same commodity is mentioned as u1f40u03b4u03ccu03bdu03c4u03b5u03c2, teeth, and at col. i, l. 5 the figure 167 must be precisely the number of the tusks, as Morelli recognized.22 It is equally unquestionable that the adjective sound (u1f51u03b3u03b9u03aeu03c2) implies an assessment of the quality of the tusks, determining which tusk is sound and which is not.23 Nonetheless, the assumption that just two terms, sound ivory and schidai, could cover the entire spectrum of possible ivory classifications is unwarranted, and the fact that in this document sound ivory and schidai are opposed to each other does not guarantee that any tusk deemed not sound is by default a schida, or that a schida, as such, cannot be sound.

    "In my view, the undeniable connection of u03c3u03c7u03afu03b4u03b1 with the verb u03c3u03c7u03afu03b6u03c9 (split, divide, cut out, tear) and the parallelism with u03c3u03c7u03afu03b6u03b1 and u03c3u03c7u03afu03b4u03b1u03be (piece of wood cut off) strongly favor Rathbones translation as fragments.24 The fact that the arabarchs took in addition as much as 22.75 minae should not bias our understanding of the Greek term. Source: Federico De Romanis (2014). Ivory from Muziris. ISAW Papers, 8.",
    "Nor should we assume that those fragments were necessarily unsound or accidental.Indeed, many of them were made on purpose and taken from perfectly sound tusks.#p11The schidai of the Muziris papyrus can hardly be identified with what elsewhere is called u03c0u03b5u03c1u03b9u03c0u03c1u03afu03c3u03bcu03b1u03c4u03b1 or u03c0u03b1u03c1u03b1u03c0u03c1u03afu03c3u03bcu03b1u03c4u03b1,25 namely, waste from the ivory carvers shops: the difference between the price of the tusks (100 drachmae per mina) and that of the schidai (70 drachmae per mina) is too small to address the gap in value between entire tusks and small scraps.26#p12In order to justify his translation of the term schidai, Rathbone recalled a passage by Pliny the Elder, in which the elephants are said to deliberately break their tusks in order to escape from hunters: u2018They themselves [sc. Source: Federico De Romanis (2014). Ivory from Muziris. ISAW Papers, 8.",
    "the elephants] know that the only thing in them that makes desirable plunder is in their weapons [u2026] and when surrounded by a party of hunters they post those with the smallest tusks in front, so that it may be thought not worth while to fight them, and afterwards when exhausted they break their tusks by dashing them against a tree, and ransom themselves at the price of the desired booty (transl. by Rackham).27#p13This passage requires two clarifications. Source: Federico De Romanis (2014). Ivory from Muziris. ISAW Papers, 8.",
    "The first is that it is part of a section comprising several other mirabilia testifying to the quasi-human affective and cognitive capacities of the elephant28u2014a rather popular topic in Western classical literature.29 The second is that it attributes to elephants a tactic comparable to that ascribed to beavers, when they are chased down by hunters.Just like elephants, beavers u2018ransom themselves with that part of their body on account of which they are chiefly sought for.30 Whatever the truth behind it, we do not need to rely on this tale to explain the ivory fragments exported from Muziris.

    "As a matter of fact, another more prosaic explanation is at hand. I propose, in fact, to identify the schidai as those fragments that are regularly trimmed from the tusks of captive elephants.#p14Tusk trimming is a standard practice in Kerala today,31 but it was also common in ancient India, as is shown in some Sanskrit classical texts.Regular trimming of elephant tusks is mentioned in the Arthau015bu0101stra, in the lines that end the section dedicated to the duties of the hastyadhyaku1e63a, the superintendent of the elephants:#p15danta-mu016bla-paru012bu1e47u0101ha-dvi-guu1e47au1e43 projjhya kalpayet /abde dvy-ardhe nadu012b-ju0101nu0101u1e43 pau00f1ca-abde parvata-okasu0101m//Leaving the double length of the circumference of the tusk at the root, he should cut [sc. the rest], every two years and a half in the case of those [sc.

    "the Indian elephants are not provided with large tusks, but should they have such, they saw them off, that their weight may not encumber them in war.34The practice of leaving u2018the double length of the circumference of the tooth at its roots addresses the need to avoid cutting into the living pulp of the tusk.35 The fact that elephants living in the mountains may get their tusks trimmed less often than those living by the riverbanks has been taken as a proof of a slower growth rate of tusks of the mountain elephants.36Schidai and the arabarchs share If the above interpretation of the term u03c3u03c7u03afu03b4u03b1 is correct, then there are consequences to be drawn related to the fiscal procedures implied in the Muziris papyrus.

    "If the schidai mentioned in the text do refer to the remnants of ivory regularly trimmed away from tusks either every two and a half or every five years, then it follows that a schida normally weighed much less than an entire tusk, since the trimming has to leave u2018the double length of the circumference of the tooth at its roots. Therefore, the 22.75 minae (around 11.6 kgs) of schidai taken in addition by the arabarchs, far from being only a fraction of a schida, will equal several schidai. Source: Federico De Romanis (2014).

    "In conclusion, whatever was taken in addition was not randomly seized because it was impossible to do otherwise, but must have been rationally determined and deliberately taken.

    "Thus, those blades, which are favored by scholars as evidence for the gladius hispaniensis (e.g., Fig. 14.1 u20132, Fig. 15), of which the waisted blade shape after all shows a strong relation to early Roman Imperial short swords of the Mainz type,19 are in their large majority from sites in contact areas between the Roman sphere of influence and the late Iron Age societies of Central and western Europe.20 In these areas, Italo-Roman imported goods were frequent components of representative behavior of higher social classes.21 Nevertheless some of the mentioned societies had independent, highly evolved traditions of sword making.  #p23 n nKeeping the above in mind, we have to assume a use of potentially Roman imported swords alongside native products that adapted an originally Roman design for locally preferred longer blades.22 The putative identified gladii hispanienses, with their blade lengths ranging between 590/600 and 700 mm, and in individual cases achieving significantly greater lengths, thus also clearly contrast with the Roman infantry u2019s short swords of the Roman Principate, with blade lengths mostly below 550 mm.

    "The linguistic/academic distinction between gladius, alias short sword, and spatha, alias long sword, common today, essentially relies on a passage of Tacitus (Annales 12.35).In this source of the late first century AD the term spatha, which is used literarily for the first time here to characterize a specific kind of sword, is contrasted with the term gladius, which was well established in literature, without any further explanation.

    "It is the adjectives added to the primary word or the literary context that allow for a more precise definition.However, in the case of the gladius hispaniensis, literary sources25 just reveal that the weapon should have been shorter than contemporary Gaulish swords.26 Their blade dimensions, between 700 and 900 mm, frequently range at the upper end of the spectrum of lengths which is ascertainable for Roman Imperial long swords.27 In the early Roman Principate, i.e., in the period in which Tacitus wrote, the longest blade normally even reached the shorter length, or at the most the lower end of the described range.28 It thus appears conceivable that the gladius hispaniensis was not an explicit short sword even by ancient or at least Roman Imperial standards, but instead was a gladius maior (=spatha) with a comparatively short blade.29 At least this would be valid for the majority of the sword finds which currently appear as gladius hispaniensis in recent literature.

A relatively homogenous group of similarly produced grips, with a certain chronological concentration in the Augustan and Tiberian period, presumably draws on Republican traditions.49 The census-relief of the so-called Ara of Domitius Ahenobarbus in Rome (late second to first half of the first century BC)50 shows Roman soldiers, and a depiction of a sword grip with similar cannelures (Fig. 17), possibly supporting the aforementioned hypothesis.

    "Due to the lack of a solid amount of preserved real weapons our knowledge in that matter is mainly dependent on more or less detailed and sometimes quite fanciful iconographical sources in the fine arts.It remains substantially unclear how and when the design of Hellenistic swords possibly picked up certain developments and inspirations from the western Mediterranean area, particularly Spain and Italy, but also Gaul, and to which degree these inspirations were related to Greek traditions and potentially oriental influences.98 In this respect, we must be aware that the partial or full classification of a few swords found in East Mediterranean sites of the Hellenistic period, such as from a grave in Jericho (West Bank; [Fig. 14.3]; ca. first half of the second century BC)99 and from the settlement finds in Delos (Fig. 14.4; terminus ante quem 69 BC),100 as Roman gladii hispanienses is quite precarious.101 Otherwise the sword from Soknopaiou Nesos would now theoretically be the third contextualized  u201cforeign find u201d of this kind in the eastern Mediterranean, while an example of the  u201cregular u201d late Hellenistic swords, which should be used by the majority in that region during the mentioned time, would be so far completely unknown to scholarship.

    "However, the blade of the weapon from Soknopaiou Nesos has the dimensions of a long sword, and even with the greatest tolerance, we can no longer assume its use by heavy Roman line infantry, i.e., by legionaries.We can consider that in the late Republican Roman army at least infantry or cavalry auxiliary contingents were mainly composed of allied peoples with still strong indigenous elements of costume and armament.102 An accurate analysis of the preserved hilt elements suggests that at least the  u201cfinal mounting u201d of the sword from Soknopaiou Nesos presumably took place in an oriental, perhaps even Egyptian workshop.

    "Greater precision typically means specifying longitudes of heavenly bodies and astrologically significant points in degrees (with or without fractions) rather than just by zodiacal signs.Additional data may be strictly astronomical, such as latitudes of heavenly bodies, cardines other than the ascendant, or dates and longitudes of syzygies close to the birthdate, or astrological, such as lots and dignities.2 A few types of additional data, for example cardines or house rulers, may appear in horoscopes that specify only zodiacal signs without degrees, but most depended on knowledge of precise longitudes in degrees, and hence only appear in horoscopes that also give that additional precision in the longitudes.  #p2 n nFour papyrus horoscopes in Neugebauer and Van Hoesen u2019s Greek Horoscopes, all for birthdates within a span of about a half century from the late first century CE to the mid second, exemplify a loose genre that can be characterized as  u201celaborate u201d or  u201cdeluxe u201d horoscopes (years cited in this paper are CE unless otherwise indicated):3  #p3 n nP.Lond. 1.130 (Hor. gr. 81.III.31 = GH 81), 81 April 1 n nP.Lond. 1.98 (Hor. gr. 95.IV.13 = GH 95), 95 April 13 n nP.Lond. 1.110 and Paris 19 (Hor. gr. 137.XII.4 = GH 137b and 137a), 137 December 4 n nP.Paris 19bis (Hor. gr. 137.XII.4 = GH 137c), 137 December 4 n n(Lond.

    "On the other hand, the tables for the Sun and Moon appear to have had similar systematic errors to Ptolemys.Perhaps the composer of the horoscope used tables from different sources for the luminaries and for the planets.An alternative possibility worth exploring is that the longitudes in the horoscope are in a sidereal frame of reference.Abundant evidence exists that when Ptolemys tables were used for astrological purposes during the third and fourth centuries, the tropical longitudes obtained from the tables were generally converted to sidereal by adding 8u00b0 minus one-eightieth of a degree for every year since 158 BCE, a formula explicitly reported by Theon of Alexandria as employed by the  astrologers of old. 14 For the nativity date, the value of this correction would have been approximately +2u00b0 3', an amount that would more or less cancel out the error of Ptolemys tropical frame of reference.

XXXV of the Liber Hermetis52 but these seem to be the monomoiriai by triplicity (also covered in Paulus,  Ch. 32).In original documentary horoscopes, the calculation of the monomoiria is rare.We find it calculated for the Midheaven, Lower midheaven, Lot of Fortune and Lot of Daimon in one  deluxe horoscope,  Oxy. astr. 4277 (Hor. gr. 150-250b).53 In the Eutocius horoscope monomoiriai are calculated for all five planets and the two luminaries, the prenatal full Moon, the Ascendant, Midheaven, Lot of Fortune and Lot of Daimon.

    "Moreover, the relative economic stability enjoyed by the region would have contributed to this pattern for similar reasons, for a stable monetary economy means that coins retain their value for longer periods, so that they are less 'expendable' and so do not become stray finds and so hoards containing those coins remain 'worth recovering'.

    "The crucial point here is that both of these markers of stability are not echoed by the numismatic record of northern Europe.This picture is further confirmed by the circulation life of the coins found in Africa compared with those from Gaul.Admittedly, the notion that Roman Africa had a thriving economy for most of the imperial period is not an entirely novel one.The reason that the evidence presented here is important is in providing confirmation that the general impression given by other types of material from the region such as textual and epigraphic records; namely, that Africas market activity required a significant amount of coinage to pay wages, buy materials, and invest into the production of a variety of consumer goods.39 Furthermore, the suggestion that the African economy remained productive even during the turmoil of the mid-third century CE and that economic and financial difficulties were lower than in in the region than in other parts of the western Empire are perhaps more contentious ideas, yet they are certainly supported by the numismatic evidence.  c) Regional Patterns  Figure 6.

A relatively low but steady loss-rate of low denomination coins, thus, fits with the idea that Africa enjoyed a well-functioning monetized economy; an economy featuring, on the one hand, enough small-scale activity so that enough of such coins were in demand that they were lost and unrecovered with some regularity, yet, on the other hand, there was a high enough need for the coins that they were not discarded in any large quantity.

    "Consequently, the focus of numismatic scholarship has traditionally been on hoarded coins, as hoards have been the most widely available and accessible context producing Roman coins.In a very important article, Reece argued that site finds should be subjected to closer scholarly scrutiny than they have in the past.49 He notes that there are 3 basic assumptions that make excavated, stray coinage suitable to analysis: first, that in a well conducted excavation, the coins uncovered will be close to the actual amount of coin loss at the site in antiquity; second, that the coins lost on a site must bear some relationship to the coinage in circulation at any given period, even if the precise relationship is not immediately apparent; and lastly, that it is possible to discern the major factors which produce stray coin finds.

    "He expands on this third point, noting that a coin is most likely to be lost and unrecovered on a particular site: a) when it is among the least valuable coins in circulation; b) when it is small compared to other examples of the same type (which likewise has to do with the coins value, since smaller coins contain less metal); c) when it is dull, namely heavily worn; d) when there are more of that type of coin circulating than other types; and e) when there is more money in general circulating at the site than at other sites, i.e. that the loss rate of coins is related to the overall level of monetization.50 These arguments convincingly show that it is necessary to include analyses of site finds in order to judge what patterns these coins exhibited and how those patterns relate to the hoarded material, as long as the distinction between these radically different contexts is properly maintained.

    "As Reece notes, the more coins there are circulating at a given place and time, the more individual coins will be lost and not recovered.Yet, this relationship is not as simple as it may first appear.Reece himself hinted at this in an earlier publication, pointing out that a slow and steady representation of coinage produced by an excavation implies that the site enjoyed a normal, regular supply of coinage for frequent and general use.53  The idea being, in other words, that a highly functioning monetary system will produce a steady yet relatively low rate of coin loss, since the coins in such an environment would be used frequently enough that only a very few of the lowest value coins will be allowed to be lost and unrecovered.

    "In a less active market environment, on the other hand, coins would be stock-pilled for a variety of purposes, such as at an army camp to be distributed to soldiers as their salary.54 Since the coins would be gathered together in a large group but actually used in market transactions less frequently, there would be less chance for individual low-value coins to be lost and scattered around a site.The most convincing idea to explain why a very large number of stray coins would be found in an excavation is that rapid debasement or a dramatic change in the monetary system suddenly makes a particular group of coins essentially valueless or demonetized, yet the intrinsic value of the coins' metal is not affected by the rising commodity prices brought on by inflation, so they are discarded in great numbers.

    "It is, in fact, one of the great mysteries of Roman coin production whether the imperial minting authorities took it upon themselves to decide when and in what quantities to send low value coins to different regions, or if the call for coins came from some authority or private citizen in the province receiving them.There is actually some evidence from the eastern Empire for this latter scenario.An inscription found at Rhodiopolis in Lycia from the second century CE honors Opramoas, a private benefactor of Rhodiopolis, for having paid for bronze coins to be minted at Rome and shipped to Rhodiopolis in order to be used by the citys residents.65 This suggests that the usefulness of small change in performing market transactions was recognized by people outside of the state apparatus, and there was demand from the users of coins to remain liquid in terms of the cash supply.

    "In other words, what did the central imperial authorities get out of Romes state-controlled minting?It must be stressed here that the act of transforming metal into coined money was itself a fairly complicated, laborious, and, most importantly, expensive undertaking in any preindustrial society, particularly the ancient world.One of the main problems faced by ancient (and, for that matter, modern) minting authorities is that coins minted in low-value metals like bronze have much smaller marginal returns than silver or gold coins, since the production costsu2014mining ore, smelting, shipping the metal, melting the refined metal, shaping flans, producing dies, stamping the coins, transporting them towards the final users and tracking every step of the processu2014are roughly equivalent regardless of the metal involved.

    "Yet, coins made from high-value metals provide a much greater return to the state which bears the cost of minting in terms of the buying power of the coins once minted than coins of less valuable metal.67  This seems, in fact, to be one of the reasons that scholars have long associated minting with large-scale state expenditure, as the easiest explanation for why an ancient state would bear the cost of minting coins is to assume that high-value coins were predominantly produced and that the main motivation was to cover the expenses incurred by the ruling authorities, namely paying soldiers and other dependents as well as rewarding loyal supporters and administrators.

    "Clearly, then, the higher the real value of the coin being minted, the easier it is for the minting authority to recover the costs of production; essentially, the marginal cost of coin production is inversely proportional to the value of the metal used in the coin.69 Further, there were limits to how small or light the state could make individual coins and still have them be large enough to be actually usable by people and acceptable as a legitimate currency.70 Thus, Roman bronze coins were only slightly fiduciary, meaning that the nominal, or face, value of the coins was not too far from their intrinsic value, or the value of the metal contained in the coin as a commodity.71  Significantly, the small marginal return from bronze coins which circulated at something approaching their intrinsic value as compared with the return on silver or gold coins means that bronze coins were particularly susceptible to changes in the value of the metal.

    "In other words, a modest rise in the commodity price of the metals needed to produce bronze coins could push the production cost over the margin, making the cost of procuring and minting the raw material greater than the finished coins economic value.72 This may, in fact, have been one of the reasons for the abandonment of bronze denominations in favor of the billon antoninianus in the 230s CE.Given how costly it was to produce bronze coins compared to other denominations and given that silver and gold coins provided such a greater return in terms of spending power, the imperial authorities must have had some compelling reason for supporting a tri-metallic monetary system for as long as they did.

    "However, since 2007 the landscape has changed dramatically.ArchaeoML never saw widespread adoption.The OCHRE project itself has since deprecated ArchaeoML, so its usefulness as a data interchange format was never realized.At the same time, more and more cultural heritage information systems began adopting the CIDOC-CRM as a standard for organizing data.The CIDOC-CRM became enshrined as an ISO standard, and is all but required by many funding agencies, particularly in the European Union. CIDOC-CRM therefore seems like a natural choice for the publication of archaeological data according to widely accepted standards. Source:  Open Context and Linked Data",
    "Over the past two years, Open Context began experimenting with publishing RDF data organized according to the CIDOC-CRM.Our experience in doing so has made us somewhat ambivalent about the effort and returns involved in aligning data to a complex ontology like the CIDOC-CRM, at least at this stage.The CIDOC-CRM represents a tremendous intellectual achievement.It results from a great amount of effort and thought by leading experts in cultural heritage informatics. Source:  Open Context and Linked Data",
    "Recent archaeology extensions of the CIDOC-CRM, led by English Heritage (Tudhope et al. 2011), also represent important informatics contributions.However, to paraphrase a famous meme,  one does not simply map to the CRM.The CIDOC-CRMs sophistication also makes it difficult to use in practice.For example, we recently had a discussion with a librarian trying to use the CIDOC-CRM to organize some archaeological data from a survey for publication in Open Context. Source:  Open Context and Linked Data",
    "The librarian used the CIDOC-CRM property  P3 has_note  as a predicate for use with Munsell color readings of potsherds.This raised some interesting issues.It is probably debatable if a Munsell color reading is simply a descriptive  note  or if a Munsell color reading is more of a measurement.If the latter, then the CIDOC-CRM property  P43F has_dimension  would probably be a more appropriate predicate. Source:  Open Context and Linked Data",
    "In theory, Munsell can be seen as an objective measurement.In practice, many researchers take Munsell readings because they vaguely think they should, and then they do not adequately control for all sorts of issues (lighting conditions, dampness, color blindness, etc.) that may impact a Munsell reading.The example above illustrate how difficult the CIDOC-CRM can be to use in practice.The CIDOC-CRM contains many conceptual nuances that can lead to different potential mappings. Source:  Open Context and Linked Data",
    "In addition, mapping to the CIDOC-CRM, or any other vocabulary or ontology for that matter, carries with it interpretive decisions.One has to make a judgement call if a Munsell reading measures a dimension or if it is simply a note.Finally, in many cases, one may not have sufficient information about a dataset to make these judgement calls.Sebastian Heath (https:github.comlawdiLAWDissues3#issuecomment-18934276) raised similar issues with respect to modeling archaeological contexts, especially from legacy excavations where the tacit knowledge behind excavation documentation may be lost. Source:  Open Context and Linked Data",
    "These issues would be easier to navigate if one could refer to established practice, and look at other examples of the CIDOC-CRM in use as a guide.However, despite the prominence of the CIDOC-CRM, it is surprisingly hard to find actual CIDOC-CRM organized datasets to use as examples, at least in archaeology.More real-world implementations of the CIDOC-CRM would provide invaluable guidance.Part of the value of referencing Pleiades comes from Pelagios (see Simon et al. 2012), a system that aggregates Pleiades annotations. Source:  Open Context and Linked Data",
    "The services provided by Pelagios make investing in Pleiades annotations worthwhile.Unfortunately, the CIDOC-CRM has no clear analog to Pelagios.We currently need to wait for mandarins of the CIDOC-CRM to review our mappings in order to get feedback, and even if this happens, our efforts would seem only relevant and noticed by a narrow audience of CIDOC-CRM aficionados.Systems that aggregate CIDOC-CRM content would be ideal, since such systems could help provide feedback about which mappings make sense and which do not. Source:  Open Context and Linked Data",
    "Without implementations that give such feedback, our experiments with mapping Open Context data to the CIDOC-CRM will go untested and mainly have theoretical value.In other words, right now, Open Contexts mappings to the CIDOC-CRM feel a little bit like eating spinach: in theory, it is good for us, but in practice, it is hard to identify its tangible benefits.Lessons on Linking Data in PracticeOur struggles with the CIDOC-CRM illustrate some of the tensions behind different visions of  Linked Data  and the  Semantic Web. Source:  Open Context and Linked Data",
    "In my view, the CIDOC-CRM represents an approach that seems very much at home with the Semantic Web. I see the Semantic Web as much more of a totalizing vision that emphasizes ontology and schema alignment between datasets across the Web.By reference to common conceptual models, the Semantic Web could enable powerful inference capabilities that draw upon logical relationships between data and ontologies. Source:  Open Context and Linked Data",
    "The problem with this vision is that non-trivial ontologies like the CIDOC-CRM can be hard to use in practice.They can be also be used inconsistently (as illustrated with the example about Munsell values above).Beyond these practical problems, the research community has yet to really grapple with the theoretical implications of ontology standards.Is the CIDOC-CRM really universally appropriate for all cultural heritage data?source:  Open Context and Linked Data",
    "Should there be room for alternative ontologies that reflect different research priorities and assumptions?In enshrining the CIDOC-CRM as an ISO standard, are we enshrining and privileging one particular (and contingent) perspective on the past without first adequately exploring other options?Again, to my knowledge, nobody has harvested CIDOC-CRM mapped data from Open Context.So I lack feedback about the quality of our implementation of the CIDOC-CRM and I lack examples of inferences made using the CIDOC-CRM and Open Context data. Source:  Open Context and Linked Data",
    "Thus, realizing the benefits of a Semantic Web vision of ontology aligned data seems remote in the areas of archaeology Open Context serves.Archaeological excavation data typically has relevance for very narrow research interests and communities.The highly specialized nature of excavation data makes it harder to build a critical mass of relevant data that would benefit from integration and comparative analysis.It is only in a few cases where Open Context has published enough relevant data to make  data integration  useful. Source:  Open Context and Linked Data",
    "Open Context recently published zooarchaeological datasets from 13 sites in Turkey that help document the transitions between hunting  gathering and agriculture  pastoralism in Anatolia between the Epipaleolithic through the Chalcolithic.The Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) sponsored the publication, integration and shared analyses of these data through a Computational Data Challenge ward.Open Contexts editors, in collaboration with the authors of the datasets, spent four months decoding and editing over records of 294,000 bone specimens from the twelve archaeological sites, and linked the data to Encyclopedia of Life and UBERON concepts. Source:  Open Context and Linked Data",
    "Incorporating Linked Data into editorial practices is not unique to Open Context.Sebastian Heath similarly includes Linked Data annotation into editorial work for the ISAW Papers publications, and Shaw and Buckland (2012) note similar editorial approaches in other humanities applications.In order to facilitate citation as well as search, browse, and retrieval features on Open Context, each dataset needed additional metadata documentation (Table 3). Source:  Open Context and Linked Data",
    "This documentation included authorship and credit information, basic project and site descriptions, keywords, relevant chronological ranges, and geospatial information needed for basic mapping (site latitude  longitude coordinates).Open Context editors also asked contributing researchers to include information on data collection methods and sampling protocols and provide documentation on each field (meaning of the field, units of measure, how determinations were made, etc.) of their submitted dataset. Source:  Open Context and Linked Data",
    "Rather than having all participants in this study analyze the entire corpus of data, each participant addressed a specific research topic using a sub-set of the data.Participants met in April 2013 at the International Open Workshop at Kiel University1 to present their analytic results on the integrated data.Project Director Arbuckle assigned each participant a topic related to taxon and methodology. Source:  Open Context and Linked Data",
    "Participants presented on topics such as  sheep and goat age data  and  cattle biometrics  (see Table 2).Following the presentations, participants discussed the results and the implications of the presented analyses for addressing the potential research topics.These presentations formed the basis of the data and discussion presented in the forthcoming collaborative research publication (Arbuckle et al. forthcoming). Source:  Open Context and Linked Data",
    "We will also publish a more in depth discussion of the editorial workflow behind the project (Kansa et al. forthcoming).The semantic issues inherent to schema mapping and the CIDOC-CRM seemed largely irrelevant to making the analysis and interpretation of these aggregated zooarchaeological datasets.Instead, more prosaic issues about vocabulary control became more important.We mainly used the EOL and UBERON as controlled vocabularies. Source:  Open Context and Linked Data",
    "Even though UBERON is a sophisticated ontology that can support powerful inferences, including inferences relating bone elements to developmental biology, embryology and genetics, making such inferences remained outside the scope of this particular study.Instead, linking these different zooarchaeological datasets to common controlled vocabularies formed the basis for aggregation and comparison.Open Contexts experience with zoooarchaeology suggests that vocabulary alignment can help researchers more, at least in the near-term, than aligning datasets to elaborate semantic models (via CIDOC-CRM). Source:  Open Context and Linked Data",
    "Furthermore, the zooarchaeologists participating in the EOL Computational Data Challenge worked with their shared data using the most simple and widely understood of data analysis technologies.Open Context simply made the vocabulary aligned data available as downloadable tables in CSV format. CSV is a very simple and rigid format that lacks the power of XML or RDF formats to express sophisticated models or schemas. Source:  Open Context and Linked Data",
    "Nevertheless, one can easily open a CSV file in a spreadsheet application like Excel, so it greatly simplifies use of shared data by researchers that lack sophisticated programming skills.In the case of the EOL Computational Data Challenge project, CSVs ease of use trumped its modeling limitations.Summary The point of this discussion is not to dismiss the CIDOC-CRM or the need for intellectual investment in semantic modeling. Source:  Open Context and Linked Data",
    "Again, the CIDOC-CRM represents a tremendous intellectual achievement and informatics researchers need to thoughtfully engage with it (rather than blindly accept it).However, many of the benefits and applications that can come with elaborate semantic modeling are thus far aspirational, especially in the context of distributed systems deployed by many different organizations and people with different backgrounds and priorities. Source:  Open Context and Linked Data",
    "To aspire to certain goals, even if not readily achievable today, is perfectly acceptable.However, long-term aspirational goals typically need to be complemented by shorter term objectives that can be realized with more incremental progress.This discussion suggests that there may be some lower-hanging, easier to reach fruit in our efforts to make distributed data work better together.The distinctions I see between the shared modeling emphasis of the  Semantic Web  and simpler cross-referencing approach of  Linked Data  can help identify the low hanging fruit. Source:  Open Context and Linked Data",
    "In Open Contexts case, we are currently using Linked Data to annotate datasets using shared controlled vocabularies.For now, that seems to meet more immediate research needs.And since applying any standard or technology involves time and effort, we see that the most cost-effective strategy to making more usable data centers on editorial practices that cross-reference Open Context data with vocabularies like EOL, UBERON and Pleiades. Source:  Open Context and Linked Data",
    "The above discussion explores our response to how we see the information environment as of late 2013.For the past six years, Open Context has worked to make data dissemination a more normal and expected aspect of scholarly practice.During this time, weve changed our approach to emphasis more formalism and editorial processes to promote quality.At the same time, the technology landscape and expectations of researchers has continually changed. I have no doubt that our approach toward Linked Open Data and semantic modeling will continue to evolve as expectations and needs evolve. Source:  Open Context and Linked Data",

A further indication that Kenchreai is within one of the multiple active regions of LRA2 production and use comes from the Eastern Korinthia Archaeological Survey (EKAS), whose members recognized that combed body sherds were among the most abundant Late Roman artifact categories.23 When one considers LRA2 broadly, the recent publication of kilns at Dilesi in Boeotia adds to the increasing firm evidence that production was widespread.24  #p14 n nThere is diversity among the LRA2 vessels from the Threpsiades complex.

    "The first two can be easily dismissed by consideration of the evidence, but the third one will require a more detailed analysis.The first option consists of reconstructing the intended arrangement of the moon phase mechanism by leaving all as in Figure 19 except the gear, which would face the other way around.But, as is evident from Figure 20, if you keep the pinhole of the arbor aligned with the slot of the gear so that the pin can be inserted, the gear would not fit inside the gear-window of the moon cap.

    "An additional problem is that the gear would be too close to the sun axis to leave room for a gear with the same number of teeth that would move the contrate gear.  #p28 n nThe second option assumes that the collar was movable.According to this possibility, the collar would have originally been between the contrate and edge a of the window.This option would make all the components fit within the cap window.

    "The collar would have had to have a hole for a pin (d in Figure 21) that, passing through the collar and the extant pinhole of the arbor, would fix the collar.Also, the arbor would have to have had another pinhole (e in Figure 21) for a second pin that, passing through it and the rectangular slot in the gear, would prevent the gear from moving to the right.The absence of any traces of a boundary between the collar and the arbor, and above all of a second pinhole in the arbor at e or of a pinhole through the collar rules out this option, since, as previously noted, the pinholes in the Mechanism are conspicuous in the CT whether their pins are still present or not.  #p29 n nThe third option takes advantage of the break between surfaces b and c.

    "According to this proposal, in its original position the gear was reversed together with the broken part of the arbor between a and b and the collar attached to it (see Figure 22).Through some accident the arbor was broken, and after this happened, someone put the broken piece with the contrate back in its part of the window pointing the wrong way.  #p30 n nThe main problems that we find with this proposal are the following. Source:  C. Carman and M. Di Cocco. (2016). The moon phase anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism. ISAW Papers, 11.",
    "First, a close inspection of the CT tends to confirm that there is a reasonably good matching break between b and c.See Figure 23.  #p31 n nSecond, in the incorrect assembly hypothesis the most reasonable reconstruction suggests that the squared collar would have been at the left extremity of the arbor.Because the collar was one piece with the arbor, it doesn u2019t make sense for the arbor to protrude beyond the collar.

    "Hence the little window that we identified as the first section of the big window would be pointless, as shown in Figure 24:  #p32 n nOn the other hand, according to the hypothesis that the contrate is preserved in its intended orientation, it is perfectly reasonable for a bit of the arbor to protrude beyond the gear window so that the pinhole in the arbor does not have to be too close to its end and so more liable to damage. Source:  C. Carman and M. Di Cocco. (2016). The moon phase anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism. ISAW Papers, 11.",
    "The fact that the gear, instead of having a hole for the pin, has a slot could indicate that a hole so close to the edge would be very fragile.The same would be the case with an arbor that was as long as the gear, but not more.  #p33 n nThird, if the pinhole of the arbor was so close to the break, one would have expected the arbor have broken through the pinhole, since this was the most fragile part the arbor.  #p34 n nFourth, there are distinct remains of the cylindrical arbor at the collar.

    "In the following CT image the circle left by the joining of the squared collar and the cylindrical arbor is perfectly identifiable.It is clear from the CT that we are seeing surface b and not surface c.  #p35 n nFifth, a close inspection of the break shows that it probably includes some little parts of the pipe itself, and not just the arbor.It would be very hard to explain on the incorrect reassembly hypothesis why the little broken pieces of the pipe are still in place.

    "These broken parts of the pipe can be observed in two places.See Figure 26 and Figure 27.  #p36 n nSixth, if the contrate originally faced the center of the moon cap and then you attempted to reverse its orientation, the teeth of the gear attached to the solar arbor that originally moved the contrate would obstruct replacing the moon cap in its original place, because the back of the contrate would collide with its teeth.9 So, there are three possibilities.

    "One is that the moon cap was never reinstalled on the Mechanism after the contrate gear was unintentionally reversed.But this is implausible, first because the moon cap is extant in fragment C, close to the zodiac and calendar rings, and second because the cap faces in the correct direction with respect to the outer part of the mechanism and the inscribed part of the rings face, which seems to indicate that it was in place at the moment of the shipwreck.

    "Secondly, someone might have tried to force the cap into place, causing still more damage (as suggested by Wright 2006: 327), but this requires that the person responsible, feeling the resistance, was too careless to look for what was wrong and notice the obvious fact that the contrate was facing the wrong way to engage with the other gear.The third possibility is that the moon cap was indeed reassembled, but the gear attached to the solar arbor was for some unexplained reason also missing, but this is clearly an ad hoc hypothesis. (This objection would also apply to the second hypothesis involving a removable collar and second pin.)  #p37 n nSeventh, we should ask how it is that the broken part is in its place, so very well aligned with the rest of the arbor.

    "We know that the part of the arbor closer to the moon ball was kept in place by the pipe, but the broken part of the arbor, the collar and the contrate gear itself would have had nothing to keep them in place.They ought to have fallen out.  #p38 n nThese are the main difficulties of the incorrect assembly hypothesis.But our proposal also presents at least one difficulty with respect to the physical remains.

    "If the extant position is the intended one, we have to postulate some additional lost gearwork to connect the solar arbor's motion to the contrate, most plausibly two extra gears, as Freeth suggested.But it seems that there is no trace of the loss of a part on which the arbor for the two extra gears could have been planted, and it is reasonable to think that it should have left a detectable trace.

    "Based on his own study of the original fragment C, Wright has made the same point in connection with both Freeth u2019s reconstruction and the one discussed here (private communication).However, we see two possible ways that the extra gears could have been mounted, either by a platform soldered to the top faces of the cheeks (see Figure 29) or by an attachment to the curb whose footprint remains on the plate (see Figure 28).  #p39 n nA further reason for suspecting the presence of the two gears (or at least of something where the two extra gears should be) is the way in which the pipe is assembled and disassembled.

    "We have already explained that, while the pin of the pipe must be removed from the inner part of the cap, the pipe has been designed in such a way that it could only be removed towards the outer part of the cap.In principle it would have been easier to remove both pieces from the same side.So, the fact that the pipe was designed to be removed to the outer face of the cap strongly suggests the presence of something in the inner part, blocking the passage of the pipe.

    "Fortunately, we have another example of this in the mechanism: the pin and slot device for producing the lunar anomalistic motion.The pin and slot device does not change the period of rotation, but produces a non-uniform motion in the output gear (see Figure 30).Gears z and y have the same number of teeth, as do gears u and x. u moves x by engagement, and x moves y by means of a pin inserted in a slot of y.

    "Therefore, x and y rotate at the same rate but, because y is eccentric with respect to x, its motion is not uniform.This non-uniform motion is transmitted by engagement from y to z.Consequently z rotates at the same rate as u, but with a non-uniform motion.The amplitude of the non-uniformity depends on the eccentricity and its period is the period of rotation of x and y.  #p42 n nProposals have recently been published for extending the pin and slot device to produce the retrograde motion of outer and inner planets.10 It is thus possible that the pin and slot device was not exclusively employed for the lunar anomaly.

    "If the designer intended to model some anomalistic period in the rotation of the moon ball, through the use of a pin and slot device, we would have an explanation for the presence of the two extra gears of Freeth u2019s arrangement (see Figure 31).  #p43 n nThis conjectural pin-and-slot device would produce an anomaly with period equal to the synodic month in the rotation of the moon phase ball, without affecting the motion of the moon pointer (i.e., the lunar sidereal motion).

    "So, we should ask: do we know of any ancient report of some sort of anomaly in the lunar phases with a period of a synodic month, independent of the lunar sidereal motion?  #p44 n nThe answer is affirmative.We know from Aristarchus of Samos u2019s On Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon (Heath 1913) that, if we accept that the ratio between the Earth-Sun distance and the Earth-Moon distance is not too great, there would be a perceptible inequality in the moon u2019s phases.

    "Aristarchus distinguished the dichotomy (when the boundary between the moon's dark and illuminated parts appears to be a straight line) from the quadrature (when the moon is exactly 90 u00b0 elongation from the sun).According to Aristarchus, the dichotomy is not produced at quadrature, but 3 u00b0 earlier at first quarter and 3 u00b0 later at last quarter (see Figure 32).  #p45 n nIf this appearance were to be modelled in the mechanism, the motion of the moon ball would have to be non-uniform: it should take more time to go from the first dichotomy to second dichotomy than from second to first.

    "The difference between these two intervals, according to Aristarchus u2019s proposal, would be around 1 day.  #p46 n nAristarchus u2019s ratio between the Earth-Sun distance and the Earth-Moon distance is not the only one attested in ancient texts, and in fact, together with that of Ptolemy (for whom it was almost the same), it is one of the greatest.Of course, the smaller the ratio, the bigger the effect.

    "So, for example, for Eudoxus the ratio was 9:1, implying a difference between quadrature and dichotomy of more than 6 u00b0; for Phidias, Archimedes u2019s father, 12:1, implying a difference of almost 5 u00b0; for Eratosthenes the ratio is a bit bigger than 5:1, implying a difference of almost 11 u00b0; and for Hipparchus, it is approximately 7:1, implying a difference of almost 8 u00b0.11 See the following animation based on Phidias u2019s proportion.  #p47 n nA one-day difference could be observed on the Mechanism.

    "One would move the moon pointer until the moon ball shows the dichotomy, note which day is indicated on the Egyptian calendar scale (or on the day-of-the-month display, if such display existed, as has been proposed)12, then crank the mechanism forward to the next dichotomy and check the date.Of course, a crucial question is whether it could be possible to distinguish the dichotomy on the moon ball within one single day.

    "Two independent observations have been made with different reconstructions of the mechanism, and in both cases the answer was positive.13 Moreover, the observations have been made assuming the maximum attested ratio of the distances (that of Aristarchus), but if the ratio between the distances was smaller, then the effect would be even greater and, therefore, easier to be detected.  #p48 n nWe must stress that if the Mechanism's designer adopted Freeth's extra pair of gears, or indeed any means of transmitting motion from the solar arbor to the moon ball's arbor that was more complicated than the obvious direct engagement of the contrate with the fixed gear as proposed by Wright, it must have been intended somehow to modify the motion that direct engagement would have produced.

(Strictly, we should not speak without qualification of a change from uniform to non-uniform motion, since the elongation displayed on the Mechanism was already affected by the lunar anomaly, though likely not by the solar anomaly14.)

    "The first part of our commentary is primarily concerned with restoring and, where necessary, correcting the data relating to the longitudes of the heavenly bodies and astrologically significant points; and the date, time, and geographical locality of the nativity.Further discussion of the astronomical and astrological data in their own right will follow in parts II and III respectively.The longitudes were expressed as zodiacal sign, degrees, and minutes.

    "The other information in the horoscope derived from the longitudes included the following:  The house ruler.This was one of the Sun, Moon, and five planets, according to a recognized scheme that assigned one complete zodiacal sign to each of the Sun and Moon, and two to each of the planets.Thus knowing the house ruler identifies the sign itself either uniquely or as one of a pair.Our horoscope is very reliable with respect to house rulers.

    "Our horoscope is usually reliable with respect to monomoiriai, but there is one clear instance of error.The triplicity (or trigon).Each set of three zodiacal signs at intervals of four signs forms a triplicity, ruled by one of the seven heavenly bodies for diurnal nativities and another for nocturnal.Since the rulers given for the triplicities in our horoscope frequently conflict with the standard system, we have not made use of this information to establish or confirm the zodiacal signs.

    "The dodekatemorion.This is a variety of scheme that associates either twelve or thirteen equal divisions of each sign of the zodiac with one of the zodiacal signs.The particular scheme used in our horoscope, as we infer from the data, takes the degrees of the longitude, disregarding the minutes, multiplies by thirteen, and counts the product from the beginning of the zodiacal sign to find the sign of the dodekatemorion.

Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "Considering only the five planets, the mean error for the papyrus is u201325', with a standard deviation of 35'; the Almagest mean error is u20131u00b0 49', with standard deviation 39'.The mean error of Ptolemys longitudes is largely due to his defective tropical frame of reference, which is about a degree off for his own time and by the date of the horoscope about a degree and a half off.13 If, as we incline to believe, the longitudes of the horoscope are to be understood as tropical, the planetary tables on which it was based seem to have reflected little error in the frame of reference. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "On the other hand, the tables for the Sun and Moon appear to have had similar systematic errors to Ptolemys.Perhaps the composer of the horoscope used tables from different sources for the luminaries and for the planets.An alternative possibility worth exploring is that the longitudes in the horoscope are in a sidereal frame of reference.Abundant evidence exists that when Ptolemys tables were used for astrological purposes during the third and fourth centuries, the tropical longitudes obtained from the tables were generally converted to sidereal by adding 8u00b0 minus one-eightieth of a degree for every year since 158 BCE, a formula explicitly reported by Theon of Alexandria as employed by the  astrologers of old. 14 For the nativity date, the value of this correction would have been approximately +2u00b0 3', an amount that would more or less cancel out the error of Ptolemys tropical frame of reference. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "It is conceivable, therefore, that the planetary longitudes in the papyrus look like tropical longitudes in an accurate tropical frame of reference because they are actually sidereal longitudes in a frame of reference that by chance nearly coincided with the true tropical frame of reference in the early fourth century.This hypothesis fails, however, to explain why the longitudes for the Sun and Moon appear to fit Ptolemys inaccurate tropical frame of reference, and moreover our reconstructed computation of the ascendant assumes that the solar longitude was understood as tropical. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "The synchronization of the longitudinal theories of the Sun and Moon is crucial for obtaining accurate times of94 syzygy.According to the JPL ephemeris, the exact opposition on November 14 occurred less than 20 minutes before the time given in the papyrus, which of course is expressed just as a whole number of seasonal hours; the Almagest theories predict exact opposition about 20 minutes later than the papyrus.  A puzzling item in the horoscope is the longitude given for the  latitude (u03c0u03bbu03acu03c4u03bfu03f2) of the Moon,  Capricorn 18u00b0 3'. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "Obviously this is not a latitude at all, nor does it have any recognizable relation to the Moons argument of latitude (167u00b0 20' from the northern limit according to the Almagest) or the nodes.We suspect that it represents the longitude of the apogee in an eccentric lunar model.Modern theory puts the lunar apogee at Capricorn 27u00b0 41', while according to the mean motions of the Almagest, this point (which has no direct role in Ptolemys epicyclic model) would have been at Capricorn 25u00b0 29' (error u20132u00b0 12'). Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "Hence if our identification is correct, the error in the apogee (u20139u00b0 38') and the resulting phase error in lunar anomaly of the tables used for the horoscope were considerably greater than Ptolemys.The incorrect designation of this position as the latitude could have resulted from eyeskip in copying a list of data relating to the Moon.We pointed out previously that if the solar tables used for the horoscope gave the same increase in the Suns longitude as the Almagest over the interval between the preceding full Moon and the nativity, the Suns longitude at the nativity should have been about Scorpio 25u00b0 8', and hence, adding the elongation 241u00b0 22', the Moons longitude should have been about Cancer 26u00b0 30'. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "Subtracting the Moons mean longitude, Cancer 24u00b0 3', we find the Moons equation to be about +2u00b0 27'.Now suppose that the lunar tables used by the horoscopes composer assumed a simple eccentric model, the eccentric counterpart of the preliminary epicyclic model of Almagest Book 4.Entering the Moons argument of anomaly (i.e. the mean Moon minus the apogee), 186u00b0 0', in the table of equations in Book 4 chapter 10, we find an equation of merely +35'. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "Obviously a simple model, even with a much larger eccentricity, could not have produced an equation of about two and a half degrees.The final lunar model of Almagest Book 5, which accounts for the Moons second anomaly by introducing a rapidly revolving eccenter bearing the epicycle, yields an equation of +1u00b0 36' because Ptolemys special definition of the apogee of the lunar epicycle introduces an adjustment (commonly called the prosneusis in modern discussions) to the argument of anomaly. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "This correction is dependent on the mean elongation of the Moon from the Sun.The equation, in turn, is dependent on this corrected argument of anomaly and on the mean elongation.Suppose now that the tables used for the horoscope assumed a model that was functionally similar to Ptolemys final model.We may assume that the mean elongation would have been very nearly the same as obtained from the Almagest theory, 238u00b0 37', but, because of the greater phase error, the mean anomaly was 186u00b0 0' instead of 178u00b0 52'. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "The so-called prosneusis correction, +13u00b0 9', is unchanged, so the corrected argument is 199u00b0 9', and the equation is +2u00b0 32'.Since this is quite close to the value we are looking for, it would appear that our conjecture is correct that the longitude Capricorn 18u00b0 3' in the horoscope refers to the apogee in lunar model in which an eccenter accounted for the first anomaly, and moreover this model also incorporated a correction for the second anomaly in a way not dissimilar from Ptolemys final model.

    "The Moons descending node is given later in the papyrus as Taurus 9u00b0 40', and, as we have seen, the Moons own longitude was near Cancer 26u00b0 30', so it would have been on the descending quadrant south of the ecliptic.If the maximum lunar latitude was assumed to be 5u00b0 (Ptolemys parameter), an argument of latitude around 166u00b0 50' would yield a latitude of u20134u00b0 52'.Only the whole number of the latitude, 4u00b0, and the indication in the third part that the Moon is moving further south survive on the papyrus.

    "Similarly Jupiter was close enough to its northern limit so that its computed trend would have been sensitive to the exact placement of the nodal line.In any case, it is obvious that the latitudinal models underlying the data in the papyrus were significantly different from either those of the Almagest or the revised models of the Handy Tables.15  The lowest register identifies a fixed star that  rises with  the heavenly body.

    "These turn out to be stars in the zodiacal belt, and the principle of their selection seems to have been proximity in longitude, not in oblique ascension; in other words, the composer of the horoscope simply consulted a star catalogue, paying attention only to the stars' longitudes.As we will see, the catalogue was similar or identical to the zodiacal star list in the Handy Tables.The text in the horoscope ( being northsouth of the star ) gives the impression that the stated number of degrees and minutes represents a difference in latitude between the star and the heavenly body, but comparison with the Handy Tables list shows that this quantity is simply the stars own latitude.

A very few include fixed stars (7), dodekatemoria (7), latitudes (5) or steps (4), presiding and managing planets (4) or monomoiriai (3).We should point out that of the extant horoscopes including additional technical data, most do not include large quantities of them, but concentrate on a few as needed for a specific interpretation.

    "These include three original horoscopes on papyri and one preserved through the medieval manuscript tradition in multiple copies.Lond. 1.130 (Hor. gr. 81.III.31 = GH 81) This papyrus horoscope is dated to March 31, 81 CE, so was likely calculated in the late first to early second century CE.32 It consists of nine columns and 213 lines, and is completely preserved.Unusually for an original documentary chart, its author, Titus Pitenius, identifies himself in a kind of colophon. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "It includes the following technical data also occurring in our horoscope: dignities (house, terms, triplicity, exaltation, decan), dodekatemoria, fixed stars, Lot of Fortune, oikodespotes.In addition, it contains information on decans in their Egyptian names, the gender and quadruplicity (tropical, solid, double-bodied) of a planets or luminarys sign, planetary phases in relation to the sun,33 and the number of days of the pregnancy.34 It is similar to our horoscope in terms of length and in the abundance of technical data calculated.

    "There is an emphasis in Lond. 1.130 on the locations of heavenly bodies and the Midheaven in relation to fixed stars or constellations.The wording used for the calculation of the Lot of Fortune is problematic, and has been addressed by both Greenbaum and Heilen.35 The calculation of the house-master (oikodespotes), which turns out to be Mercury, is consistent with the rules of Vettius Valens, Dorotheus and, later, Porphyry.36 Dodekatemoria are calculated (wrongly, as Neugebauer and Van Hoesen correctly note)37 only for the Sun and Moon.

    "The  Eutocius  horoscope (Hor. gr. 497.28 = GH L497) Dated October 28, 497, this horoscope is transmitted complete in two Byzantine Greek manuscripts, Laur.Plut. 28,34 ff. 141v-143v, and Par. gr. 2425 ff. 216v-219v, under the title  From the astrological writings [u1f00u03c3u03c4u03c1u03bfu03bbu03bfu03b3u03bfu03c5u03bcu03adu03bdu03c9u03bd] of Eutocius,  and abridged in a few other manuscripts without the attribution to Eutocius.41 Its author is presumably Eutocius of Ascalon (fl. early sixth century CE), the author of extant commentaries on mathematical works of Archimedes and editor of a recension (with commentaries) of Books 1-4 of Apolloniuss Conics.42 The introductory passage indicates that the horoscope is offered as an example of how  the computation of a chart  should be set out; in other words, it is a didactic model that, unlike most horoscopes provided in ancient astrological treatises, is meant to illustrate not techniques of astrological prognostication but rather the format appropriate for an elaborate horoscope.43 It is in fact one of the most elaborate horoscopes we have.

Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "This exposition will provide possible rationales for including them in the calculation of a horoscope.The data to be discussed are:  Dignities Monomoiria Dodekatemoria Presiding and Managing Length of life Pre-natal syzygy Master of the nativity Lots Astrological manuals of the Greco-Roman period and Late Antiquity may supply both methods and reasons for the technical data used by practicing astrologers. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "Often, they are not used in a vacuum, but can be intertwined with one another to produce an interpretation for specific concerns a client might have, such as happiness, fortune and length of life.For our particular horoscope, doctrines outlined by Paulus Alexandrinus, a fourth-century CE astrologer practicing in Alexandria, frequently coincide with those used in our horoscope. A number of them are given a thorough treatment in Pauluss Introduction to Astrology, produced in 378 CE. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "The works of other astrologers will also be consulted in elucidating the reasons for using specific techniques.For astrologers, horoscope interpretation necessarily involves a number of factors to be synthesized and applied.The Compendium of Rhetorius (fl. probably 6th century CE)46 provides instructions for applying these.It includes seven considerations for the astrological interpretation of a birthchart, especially in delineating the circumstances at birth, the parents, and fortunate or unfortunate life circumstances. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "Technical data to be considered include dignities (especially triplicitytrigon lords), the latitude of the Moons winds, the position of the new or full moon prior to birth, lots (especially the Lots of Fortune, Daimon, Basis and Exaltation), and the ascending and descending nodes of the Moon.Another text, attributed by Franz Cumont to a Byzantine compiler who excerpted Rhetorius (Par. gr. 2506, fol. 73 and Ven. 7, fol. 170, in CCAG 8.1: 243-244) tells us to examine  the decans or faces...the monomoiriai, the bright degrees, the dodekatemoria, and the latitudes of the winds and the steps; the phases, stations and the co-risings of the fixed stars nearest by degree to them... .47 The same document also recommends looking at the pre-natal conjunction or opposition of Sun and Moon (i.e. new or full Moon). Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "Thus, as outlined by Rhetorius, our papyrus gives data for performing a very complete horoscope analysis.Dignities Dignities are frequently added to extant horoscopes, as well as mentioned in astrological manuals. A definition of each type of dignity used in our horoscope can be found above in the astronomical commentary.Dignities are important in interpretation because they allow assessment of the quality and power of the planet involved. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "They also allow the astrologer to assess the interaction between planets based on their rulerships and rulers.Each kind of dignity can provide more nuance in evaluation.For example, the term ruler of a luminary was often used as a factor in length of life.But the various rulers u2013 house, exaltation, triplicity, term and decan u2013 could also be used to find an overall chart ruler, or the ruler of a specific topic.48 This discussion will briefly give some of the reasons that dignities are used in astrological interpretation, accompanied by the details of our horoscope.  1. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "House rulership.This is the most commonly reported dignity, and often mentioned in chart interpretation.The house ruler is essential to the construction of the  thema mundi,  a symbolic chart for the birthday of the cosmos,49 where each planet falls in one its zodiacal houses.The nativity of any person can be compared to the thema mundi as an example of an  ideal  chart.50 In our horoscope, the house ruler is missing for the Sun (as all details are) and Moon. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "All other house rulers are correct.  2.Term rulership.In systems of finding rulers for length of life, the term ruler of a  predominating  planet can become the primary indicator of longevity.In our horoscope all the term rulers are correct except for Venus, which (using the Egyptian system) should be in the terms of Mars, not Saturn.  3.Triplicity rulership.The triplicity lords, especially of the sect luminaries (i.e., the Sun for a day chart and the Moon for a night chart), are used for different purposes, including assessments for eminence (Valens, Anthology II, 2 and 22 [Pingree 1986]) and for gaining happiness, fortune or property (Dorotheus, Carmen Astrologicum I, 24-26 and Valens II, 2). Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "In our horoscope, triplicity rulers are given for eight positions including the lunar nodes (Sun is missing).For four planets these are correct: Moon, Saturn, Venus and Mercury; incorrect are the triplicity rulers for Jupiter, Mars and both lunar nodes.The errors show a tendency on the part of the charts composer to list the diurnal triplicity rulers for earth and water instead of the nocturnal rulers.  4. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "Exaltation and Depression.The effect of exaltation is similar to that of house. A planet in its exaltation is fortified for effective action, and can aid planets located in its sign of exaltation.Conversely, a planet in the sign of its depression is weak and ineffective, or even harmful.In our horoscope the exaltations are given for four positions: Saturn, Jupiter, Venus and the descending node (the Moons is missing, and no planets are exalted in the signs of Scorpio and Sagittarius, where Mars, Mercury and the ascending node are located). Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "Depressions are given for Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars and the ascending node (there is no exaltation or depression in Sagittarius, where Mercury lies, and in Taurus, where the descending node lies).All exaltations and depressions are accurate.Monomoiriai Our horoscope includes data on monomoiriai by sign.Chapter 5 of Pauluss Introduction explains this doctrine (another form, by trigontriplicity, is discussed in Chapter 32). Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "This process is dependent on the house-ruler of the sign, and the so-called Chaldean order of the planets (Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon).To find the planetary ruler of the monomoiria (which means u2018single degree) of a signs degree, one starts with the house ruler of that sign, which rules its first degree.Thus, for Aries and Scorpio, Mars is the ruler of the first degree.The process continues with the planets in Chaldean order through the rest of the degrees of Aries and Scorpio u2013 the second degrees ruler is the Sun, the third degrees Venus, and so on. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "For the Venus-ruled signs of Taurus and Libra, one begins with Venus for the first degrees ruler, Mercury for the second degree, Moon for the third degree, Saturn for the fourth degree, and so on.Paulus provides a table at the end of Chapter 5. A scholion for this chapter51 states that monomoiriai can connect (by  sympathy ) two planets otherwise unrelated to each other, since it assigns degrees based on planets ruling signs that may not make a conventional aspect, such as Aries and Scorpio (both ruled by Mars). Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "Valens mentions monomoiriai in his Anthology, IV, 26 (Pingree 1986), which seem to operate under the same set of rules that Paulus gives for the monomoiria by sign.Monomoiriai are also mentioned in Ch. XXXV of the Liber Hermetis52 but these seem to be the monomoiriai by triplicity (also covered in Paulus,  Ch. 32).In original documentary horoscopes, the calculation of the monomoiria is rare.We find it calculated for the Midheaven, Lower midheaven, Lot of Fortune and Lot of Daimon in one  deluxe horoscope,  Oxy. astr. 4277 (Hor. gr. 150-250b).53 In the Eutocius horoscope monomoiriai are calculated for all five planets and the two luminaries, the prenatal full Moon, the Ascendant, Midheaven, Lot of Fortune and Lot of Daimon. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "In our horoscope, the monomoiriai are all correct except for that of Mercury.Dodekatemoria Dodekatemorion means, simply, u2018twelfth-part.It can be used to refer to any twelfth-part of something u2013 a twelfth-part of the 360u00b0 circle, i.e. one zodiacal sign; a twelfth-part of a sign of 30u00b0, i.e. 2 u00bdu00b0; or any portion of 12 degrees.The concept originates with the Babylonians.54 Paulus discusses the doctrine of dodekatemoria in Chapter 22. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "The doctrine is known in other authors, such as Julius Firmicus Maternus (Mathesis II, 13.2-3), but Firmicus multiplies the degrees of the sign by 12 and adds that sum to 0u00b0 of the sign to produce the dodekatemorion, while Paulus multiplies by 13, which effectively takes into account the actual degree of the sign in question.The Babylonian system, as Rochberg demonstrates, matches what Paulus does:  Given a position in the zodiac (longitude [l]1 expressed in degrees (n) of a zodiacal sign (z), a second position in the zodiac (l2) [i.e. the dodekatemorion] may be obtained by multiplying the degrees n by 12 and adding the result to the first longitude [l1 = nu00b0 of z]: l2 = 12n + nu00b0 of z. 55 As an example, Paulus gives Aries 11u00b0. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "He multiplies the degrees by 13, yielding 143u00b0.He adds that sum to the beginning of Aries: 143u00b0 + 0u00b0 [Aries 0u00b0] = 143u00b0 = Leo 23u00b0. (Effectively 12n + n + z = 13n + z.)  Olympiodorus (Ch. 20; Boer 1962: 41.12-20) uses the example of an Ascendant at Scorpio 20u00b0.Multiplying 20u00b0 by 13 = 260u00b0.Add that to the beginning of Scorpio, i.e. 210u00b0: 260u00b0 + 210u00b0 = 470u00b0. 470 - 360 = 110u00b0, or Cancer 20u00b0. (Olympiodorus explains this differently, but effectively this is what he is doing.)  The calculation of dodekatemoria is rare in original documentary horoscopes, as we saw above.56  In our horoscope only the sign of the dodekatemorion is given, not the degrees. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "The dodekatemoria for the Moon, Saturn, Jupiter (for the corrected position of Virgo 3u00b0 40', not Virgo 7u00b0 40'), Mars and Venus match what the Paulus formula would produce.However, the positions of Mercury, both lunar nodes and the prenatal full Moons dodekatemoria do not match what Pauluss formula would produce (they do match the Firmicus formula which also fits for Saturn, Jupiter [corrected position] and Mars). Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "Two possibilities could explain this result.First, the birthcharts constructor did use the Paulus formula, but neglected to calculate the minutes of each position, at least for Mercury, the nodes and the prenatal full moon (the dodekatemorion for Mercury is Gemini 0u00b0 29', almost in Taurus where the text says it is).Since no degrees are given for the dodekatemoria, only signs, this could have been a further truncation of the entire procedure. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "Or, the charts constructor could have been using the Firmicus formula, but miscalculated for the Moon and Venus.Paulus tells us that this procedure is important for obtaining information about whether someone will be u2018fortunate, long-lived and blessed (Ch. 22, Boer 1958: 46.15-16) or make them u2018laborers, ... unable to acquire property and cursed(Ch. 22, Boer 1958: 46.21-22); such people will also have short lives, violent deaths, illnesses and injuries (Ch. 22, Boer 1958: 46.23). Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "If the dodekatemorion of a benefic falls in the sign of the natal Sun, Moon, Mercury, cardines, Lots of Fortune, Daimon or Necessity, or on the prenatal lunation, this is said to be fortunate, but when a malefics dodekatemorion falls there, the effects are unfortunate.Presiding and Managing Few authors except for Paulus mention the concept of presiding and managing.The earliest appears to be Serapion, in a text on katarchai.57 Antiochus of Athens58 gives outcomes for those born when certain hour rulers manage during a day, usually based on whether the planetary ruler is a benefic or malefic. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "Another text, by  Zenarion  (about whom nothing further is known) also uses the technique in katarchic charts.59  In Chapter 21,  On the Star Presiding and the One Managing  Paulus outlines the technique and promotes its use both in nativities and katarchai.He further approves its use in decumbitures, a chart cast for when an ill person takes to his or her bed.Pauluss method depends, first, on finding the god ruling over the day in question (Ch. 20, u2018On Knowing to which of the Gods Each Day Belongs). Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "This is the god traditionally assigned to each day of the week.Thus, if the day in question is a Sunday, the Sun is the god of the day.Once the god (i.e. planet) of the day is known, that planet presides over the entire 24-hour day, which is sectioned into 12 day and 12 night hours.60 The presiding planet rules the 1st,  8th, 15th and 22nd hours of that day.The hour rulers are assigned in the so-called Chaldean order from the presiding planet, and become the u2018managers of that hour, beginning with the first hour of the day. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "Olympiodorus, Pauluss commentator, covers the same material (Ch. 18).As an example, the well-known katarchic horoscope for the crowning of Leontius at Antioch (Hor. gr. 484.VII.18 = GH L484), lists Mercury as u03c0u03bfu03bbu03b5u03c5u0301u03c9u03bd and u03b4u03b9u03b5u0301u03c0u03c9u03bd, and uses this as the reason the chart was not successful:  but they [the astrologers] did not pay attention, first, that the presiding and managing [planet], Mercury, had fallen into misfortune (u03b5u1f30u03c2 u03c0u03b1u0301u03b8u03bfu03c2). Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "For it was at its greatest [distance] from the Sun, which brings about violent death, and it was aspected only by Saturn. 61  Only three other extant horoscopes include this technique: all are from literary sources, with dates in the fifth century CE (Hor. gr. 475.VII.16 = GH L475, Hor. gr. 479.VII.14 = GH L479, and 487.IX.5 = GH L487, the last of which mentions only the managing ruler).In our horoscope, the planets presiding and managing are listed as Jupiter and Saturn. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "These would be correct if this was a diurnal chart for the 7th hour of the day of 319 CE, November 19, but this horoscope is nocturnal and belongs to the night preceding the day of November 19.62 In the system outlined by Paulus, and also mentioned by Vettius Valens, an anonymous Christian writer on the hours of the day of the week, and Cassius Dio,63 the 24-hour day begins at sunrise with the planetary day hours. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "This is the usual epoch for this system, probably arising from the fact that the Hellenistic Egyptians began the day at sunrise.But other epochs were also in use, in which the 24-hour day could begin at sunset.64 Neugebauer and Van Hoesen mention horoscopes in the fourth century that use an evening epoch, and a calendar of 354 CE does as well.65  So it seems that the author of our horoscope was using an evening epoch with the Alexandrian calendar, where the day begins at sunset, and begins it by applying the usual rulers of the day hours to this evening epoch. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "Even though it was still Wednesday, November 18, in a day epoch (where the presiding planet would be Mercury and the managing planet, Mars, rules the 7th hour), in an evening epoch the presiding planet would be Jupiter (the presiding planet for Thursday November 19, 319), and the planet managing the 7th hour is Saturn.Because the beginning of the text is lost, we cannot know for certain how the author dated it. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "But this explanation seems plausible based on our knowledge of the use of epochs in this timeframe.Though it does contradict the common practice of planetary days and hours outlined by Paulus, the author was not necessarily incorrect in using the day rulers for an evening epoch, even if he was unorthodox.Length of Life: Master of the Nativity and the Prenatal Syzygy Although we have no way of knowing how the author of our chart planned to use the calculated information, discovering length of life is an important consideration addressed by ancient astrologers. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "Aside from the use of term rulers, two of the techniques used to determine this are included in our chart: the housemastermaster of the nativity, and the prenatal syzygy.Master of the Nativity This is yet another technique mentioned by Paulus in his Introduction.Chapter 36,  On Housemastership  (u03a0u03b5u03c1u1f76 u03bfu03b9u0313u03bau03bfu03b4u03b5u03c3u03c0u03bfu03c4u03b5u03b9u0301u03b1u03c2), provides the conditions under which a planet may become the chart ruler (or, to use Pauluss term, the u03bau03c5u0301u03c1u03b9u03b1 u03c4u1fc6u03c2 u03b3u03b5u03bdu03b5u0301u03c3u03b5u03c9u03c2, authority of the nativity). Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "The Sun and Moon are most important in this process, the Sun being used in a day chart, but the Moon at night.In a nocturnal chart, as ours is, one looks at the term-ruler and house-steward (u03bfu03b9u0313u03bau03bfu03b4u03b5u0301u03bau03c4u03c9u03c1) of the Moon, and then at whether the Sun or Moon (depending on the sect of the chart) are in u2018effective places.At night, the effective places are the four cardines, the fifth (Good Fortune), eleventh (Good Daimon), second and eighth. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "Let us apply these rules to our papyrus.In a nocturnal nativity, we look at the Moon.We know that the Ascendant is Virgo 10u00b0 57', and that the Moon is likely to fall between 24u00b0 (roughly its mean position) and 27u00b0 Cancer.Using the whole-sign place system, the Moon will fall in the 11th place, that of the Good Daimon, which is an effective place.The term-ruler for the Moon at 26u00b0 Cancer is still Jupiter, but in the next degree moves to Saturn in the Egyptian system. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "That the horoscope gives Jupiter as the u2018master of the nativity would therefore suggest a position of around 26u00b0 for the Moon (as also suggested in Part I of this commentary).The house-steward of the Moon in Cancer is, of course, the Moon.Jupiter is also in an effective place, the first (including the entire sign of Virgo as the first place).So far it seems that the Moon and Jupiter have equal claim on rulership. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "Then Paulus says  when one star has more counts than the others and is found at morning rising [in a phase of visibility] on a cardine and in its own throne, this one has the rulership, especially if it oversees (u03bau03b1u03c4u03bfu03c0u03c4u03b5u03c5u0301u03c9) the sect luminary. 66 Jupiter has no counts of rulership in the early degrees of Virgo (in fact, its depression is Virgo).It sextiles the Moon, the sect luminary, by sign (but in fact, by degree makes no aspect). (It also sextiles the other luminary, the Sun, by sign.) It is in a phase of visibility, and would appear in the eastern sky before the sun rises. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "It is also in a cardine, the Ascendantfirst place.By contrast, the Moon is in its own house and face, which would give it two counts to Jupiters zero.It is not on a cardine, but it is the sect luminary.This would seem to give the Moon an edge over Jupiter.Further, since both Jupiter and the Moon are in effective places, and Paulus says that if a luminary is in an effective place it becomes the ruler, it would seem that the Moon should have been chosen. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "However, it may be that the astrologer has (incorrectly) moved to Pauluss next condition: examining the term-ruler, triplicity lord or house-steward of the prenatal Full Moon (for a nocturnal birth).The Prenatal Syzygy The preceding full Moon took place at Taurus 20u00b0 30'.This is the house of Venus, the term of Jupiter and the triplicity of the Moon.This position falls, however, in the ninth place, not usually considered an effective place (although it is a  good decline  and the place of the Sun god).67 If the prenatal full Moon is not in an effective place, Paulus says, one must look at the triplicity, house and term rulers of the Lots of Fortune or Daimon; and also the lord of the Ascendant. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "The Lot of Fortune falls in the 10th degree of Capricorn: triplicity of the Moon, house of Saturn and term of Jupiter.The Lot of Daimon falls in the 13th degree of Taurus: triplicity of the Moon, house of Venus, term of Mercury.The lord of the Ascendant is Mercury.We know that the Moon and Jupiter are in effective places; Saturn is in the eighth (effective), Venus in the second (also effective) and Mercury in the fourth (effective). u2018And if the one ruling these places is found being aspected in the aforegiven places with that one which it has received, it will be taken as the authority of the nativity.68 In our chart, the Moon opposes Fortune by sign, Saturn squares it and Jupiter trines it. Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",

    "Besides his later commentator Olympiodorus, he is the only author in the extant corpus to provide formulae for these lots.His chapter on lots mentions each by name, with its formula, and associates it with a planet:  Suitably, the lots have this origin: since by nature the Moon is set down as Fortune, the Sun Daimon, Aphrodite Eros, the [star] of Hermes Necessity, that of Ares Courage, that of Zeus Victory, and that of Kronos Nemesis. 70 This order matches the listing of the lots in our horoscope.

    "However, the formulae they use for the Lots of Eros and Necessity are not those that Paulus specifies in his astrological treatise.79 Thus, before the fourth century CE, no documentary evidence exists for use of the Paulus formulae, and no calculation of the Lots of Courage, Victory or Nemesis.In astrological texts said to antedate Paulus, only Antiochus of Athens provides a short section on these lots (see below). Source:  P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice ",
    "Previous work on lots has posited two traditions of calculation for the lots of Eros and Necessity.80 One tradition may be designated  Hermetic,  after the assertion by Olympiodorus and a scholiast for Paulus that these lots derive from a book by Hermes Trismegistus called the Panaretos.81 The other tradition is called  Egyptian,  drawing on a scholion to a passage in Hephaestios Apotelesmatika III, 6.11, describing two methods for casting the Lots of   Necessity and Eros according to Hermes Trismegistus or, just as in the 4th book, Dorotheus gives an account of the opinion of the Egyptians. 82 This scholion thus supplies evidence of two lot traditions for these lots in antiquity.

    "One of Pauluss passages on the planetary lots has a number of similarities to a passage that the later compiler Rhetorius claims are from the Thesaurus of Antiochus of Athens, whose probable floruit was the second century CE.Antiochus associates a planet or luminary with each lot, but gives no formula to calculate them, or an origin (we can assume they are the same lots Paulus describes because of the similar wording).83 Possibly Paulus and Antiochus drew on a similar source, or Paulus was the first to come across this passage by Antiochus, because no other author in the extant literature before 378 CE mentions such lots.

    "The chief reason that ancient hoards went un-collected is that the people who buried it moved away or died before they had a chance to recover the material, spend it, move it, or melt it down for its metal; and the most common cause of this in antiquity was warfare.In other words, the number of coins found in a given region, especially those found in hoards, can be a strong positive proxy for the level of military and political turmoil in that region.20  #p20 n nThis is not to say that hoarding itself was driven solely by warfare, that people would bury coins out of fear of invading troops.

    "This is a particularly salient point when considering the numismatic record from North Africa, for the region remained remarkably stable in terms of military conflict, political instability, disease, and other markers of turmoil compared to northwestern Europe throughout the imperial period and even into the chaotic third century CE.21 The relative paucity of numismatic material from Africa during this period, then, may be in part a product of this relative freedom from warfare, rather than an indication of a poorly-functioning monetary economy.

    "Moreover, the relative economic stability enjoyed by the region would have contributed to this pattern for similar reasons, for a stable monetary economy means that coins retain their value for longer periods, so that they are less 'expendable' and so do not become stray finds and so hoards containing those coins remain 'worth recovering'. I treat the important topic of recoverability in more detail below.  #p21 n nConcerning the evidence that we do have, as is immediately apparent from Table 2, of coins minted before 235 CE, the denarius and sestertius are by far the most frequently occurring in the evidence, representing 45% and 49% of the total, respectively.

    "There are fewer denarii and sestertii known from the Gallic provinces and Britain than I have been able to gather from Africa.What this means in terms of the type of coins circulating in different parts of the Empire, then, is that the coin populations of Roman Africa seem to have been considerably more stable than in northern Europe at least up to the mid-third century;31 although in both regions the preponderance of antoniniani minting certainly had a significant effect on circulation patterns after 235 CE, sestertii and denarii remained in circulation after this date in greater numbers in Africa than elsewhere.  #p28 n nb) Chronological Patterns n nPerhaps the most important patterns, and the aspect which most sets Africa u2019s monetary history apart from that of other areas of the western Empire, are the chronological ones.

    "It is also notable that, although fewer denarii minted after 235 CE have been in Africa than specimens minted earlier, the denomination does not disappear completely until fairly late in the third century.This lends further support to the notion that Africa enjoyed a relatively stable monetary and economic life throughout the third century.It also suggests that, although the region likely did experience some inflationary tendencies after about 160 CE,38 inflation was not particularly severe there until the 250s at the earliest (I discuss the relationship between inflation and these changes in more detail below).

    "The crucial point here is that both of these markers of stability are not echoed by the numismatic record of northern Europe.This picture is further confirmed by the circulation life of the coins found in Africa compared with those from Gaul.Admittedly, the notion that Roman Africa had a thriving economy for most of the imperial period is not an entirely novel one.The reason that the evidence presented here is important is in providing confirmation that the general impression given by other types of material from the region such as textual and epigraphic records; namely, that Africas market activity required a significant amount of coinage to pay wages, buy materials, and invest into the production of a variety of consumer goods.39 Furthermore, the suggestion that the African economy remained productive even during the turmoil of the mid-third century CE and that economic and financial difficulties were lower than in in the region than in other parts of the western Empire are perhaps more contentious ideas, yet they are certainly supported by the numismatic evidence.  c) Regional Patterns  Figure 6.

    "Introduction: LOD - Terror and PromiseLinked open data (LOD) can be a frightening concept.Far from the conventional model of research, where a monograph or article is a well-formed, clean, and polished culmination of inquiry conducted in private, LOD is public, often messy, and rarely seen as finished.Somewhat equivalent to electronically providing notes or a card-index, LOD is a collaborative enterprise which stresses open-access, connectivity, and new ways of thinking about publication and research which are often at odds with traditional models of recognition and reward. LOD also pushes many practitioners out of their traditional areas of expertise, with unfamiliar and often intimidating terms, technical jargon, and challenging infrastructure requirements.1Despite these supposed obstacles, there is a remarkably robust community of practitioners and projects that embrace LOD methodology in the humanities, and in particular in the field of ancient studies.

    "What follows is an overview of structuring and preparing data to get the best use of LOD resources.LOD: A (Quick!) OverviewFirst, it is important to understand the concepts underlying linked data and LOD.Linked data has essentially four components: it is data that is on the web; it has a stable address (a URI) that provides information about a resource; that information is in a standard format; and there are links to other URIs about the same or related subjects.4 For example, a project that centers on the Roman empire could have a page on the city of Rome with a URI of exampleproject.orgRome, which fulfills the first two conditions.

    "This can take the form of a simple script, or a more complex database query.If the external data has a geospatial component this process can be aided by setting spatial parameters: for example, if you know all of the data in your project is in the Eastern Hemisphere, you could automatically reject any matches that occur in North and South America.Depending on the data contained within a project and an external LOD source such matches could be refined even further, by restricting the data type (only matching people records, only matching places that are settlements, etc.), date range, or any other data attribute.

    "The human measurement of time lends itself to computation, but it also presents particular problems for computers.Anyone who remembers the short-lived panic over Y2K, the idea that the turn of the millennium would break computer systems that had been built to understand the date 00 only as 1900, can confirm this.On the one hand, humans have for a very long time measured time by observable, predictable, and quantifiable natural cycles, especially the movement of the celestial bodies.

    "The most obvious of these cycles are the alternation of light and dark as the Earth spins on its axis, the waxing and waning of the moon, and the shifting position of the sun in the sky as the Earth progresses through the full circuit of its orbit.These are the same for everyone on the surface of the planet.On the other hand, some of these phenomena are not in sync with others (for example, the lunar versus the solar cycle) u2013 and more importantly, the conceptual division and verbal expression of time has varied widely across cultures from the beginning of written history to the present. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Human beings have kept time in terms of more or less accurate solar years; lunar months, which do not coincide with solar years; the movement of the stars across the sky over a solar year; the count of days or years or cycles from a culturally-significant starting-point; repeated or extraordinary events; and so on.And they have created larger subdivisions of time on the basis of perceptions of associated attributes, with more or less specific boundaries: these have had many names (genos, saeculum, epoch, age, era), but outside of the specific system of geological description, they are now most commonly referred to in English by the term period.This tension between the quantifiable and the conceptual offers both opportunities and challenges to producers and users of temporal digital data. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The opportunities are clear in the Big Data revolution in information science, which makes extensive use of time-stamped information: in fact, the vast quantities of spatial data being harvested from cell-phones and social-media use would be much less valuable without associated times and dates (it is not as useful to know where something is happening if you don't know when it is happening).These time-stamps are invariably expressed in terms of divisions used in the time-keeping system of the modern West u2013 that is, years of 365 days with an extra day every four years, counted up from the birth of Christ and modified by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582 to bring the length of the year into harmony with the solar equinoxes (the Gregorian calendar); twelve months, each composed of a number of days between 28 and 31; and a night-and-day cycle composed of 24 hours, each of which is divided into 60 minutes, each of which can be divided in turn into 60 seconds.

    "The consistency and interoperability of this convention means that millions of records can be visualized in time as well as space, revealing patterns in human activity that would be impossible to reconstruct at this scale without digital means (Deville et al. 2014).But as fears of a Y2K bug showed, interoperability is vulnerable to simple differences in notation, which emerge as soon as cultural differences and changing conventions are taken into account.

    "In US notation, 610 is June 10th; in most European countries, it is October 6th.Over the last several decades, the notations and (Before Christ and Anno Domini) have been replaced for socio-cultural reasons.As one moves back in time or further afield in space, things become even more complicated.The traditional Islamic calendar, used for the calculation of festivals, is lunar, and is reckoned from the flight of Muhammed to Medina; the Hebrew and Chinese calendars are both lunisolar but begin their counts at different moments, and all three calendars change from the old to the new year in different months, none of which coincide with the Gregorian new year.

    "The Gregorian calendar replaced the Julian calendar, which, because it was slightly longer, drifted over time with respect to the solar year, and in order to make the correction advanced the date by several days u2013 but it was only gradually adopted outside the Catholic world, and in some places the Julian calendar was still used for civic date-keeping into the 20th century (this is why the October Revolution in Russia is dated in current terms to the beginning of November). Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "By the time we get back to antiquity, the variety of dating systems is dizzying, as Thucydides' famous expression of the date of the Theban raid on Plataea shows:In the fifteenth year [of the truce], in the forty-eighth year that Chrysis was priestess at Argos, with Ainesios as ephor at Sparta and with Pythodorus still being archon at Athens for another two months, six months after the battle at Potidaia and at the beginning of springu2026 (Thuc. 2.2)At least the dates in all of these systems are quantifiable, and calculations can be performed to reconcile them, as I will discuss below. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The situation becomes even more complicated when one is dealing with historical periods, which have more and more imprecise dates the further one moves back in time u2013 and the boundaries and names of which can differ not only from culture to culture, but also from scholar to scholar.Both boundaries and terminology can also change over time as new evidence is collected or new historical paradigms are adopted. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Periods are not real, quantifiable historical phenomena; they are conceptual divisions created, usually after the fact, to organize information for particular discursive communities, and they generally have spatial boundaries as well as temporal ones.As a result, the reconciliation of different period expressions in different datasets requires an act not only of calculation, but of translation.To make matters even more complex, periods are often bounded by events, which themselves have both names and duration in time and thus echo the structure of the period for which they provide start and end dates.This complexity must be taken into account when one attempts to convey temporal information as structured data, and the representation of time in datasets modeled as Linked Data presents additional challenges and considerations. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "This chapter addresses time as structured data and as Linked Data, beginning with the simplest modeling and expression of Gregorian calendar dates before moving on to the modeling and expression of periods and other temporal expressions.It assumes a basic familiarity with the idea of Linked Data and text markup as conveyed in other chapters in this work (those on Nomisma and SNAP, for example), but it will attempt to frame the material as recipes accessible to those with little experience in this area. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Before we turn to technical details, however, I would like to note that the first question to ask is not how do I make my data into Linked Data? but what kinds of data am I modeling, for whom and for what purpose?.Time-stamped data u2013 social media posts, phone-calls, digital images or computer files u2013 contain information about absolute, continuous time represented with a high degree of precision, sometimes down to the second. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Relative expressions of time of the sort used in natural language (after last week, during the Hellenistic period), on the other hand, cannot easily be converted into years, days, hours and minutes.Absolute and relative temporal data therefore require different modeling and offer different possibilities for aggregation and analysis.While absolute numeric values only need to be expressed in a consistent format to be legible for a computer, relative designations of time in a dataset require both normalization of human-readable terms (choosing to use either Late Roman or Late Antique, but not both) and additional parsing to enable absolute dating (stating the start and end dates of Late Roman in the context of a given dataset). Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Linked Data approaches make it possible to connect one's own terms with standard defined vocabularies u2013 dictionaries of appropriate terms u2013 like the Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), and they also permit connections with resources that specify absolute temporal boundaries for periods, like PeriodO or chronOntology.Projects seeking simply to normalize their temporal vocabularies might only need an external thesaurus, but projects interested in facilitating chronological search or visualization may also have to address the parsing of relative temporal terms in absolute time. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "It is therefore important to consider, at the beginning of a project, what kinds of temporal information will be included, how that data will be used by the project itself, and how it might be reused by others in the future.This chapter will begin by discussing standards, formats, and issues in the representation of absolute time, and then addresses the ways in which Linked Data approaches can enrich and connect relative temporal expressions on a semantic level as well. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The first sections will deal with calendrical systems and machine-readable date formats, while the following sections introduce the semantic representation of both absolute dates and the relative chronological concept of the period.The final section provides a brief guide to the creation of new referenceable period definitions in the PeriodO Linked Data gazetteer.Absolute Time: Calendar DatesOf course all expressions of time are relative to some extent, in that dates are expressed in relation to a particular point of reference. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Different points of reference account for different calendar systems.For the purposes of this chapter, however, absolute time refers to numeric dates expressed in any given calendar system, while relative temporal expressions are those that lack any inherent numeric dates.It is easier to standardize datasets in which chronological information is expressed in terms of absolute calendar dates, to ensure that this information can be consistently read and understood by both humans and computers. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Let us take as an example a spreadsheet listing Greco-Roman papyri that includes a column labeled date, containing heterogeneous absolute date values such as April 21, AD 565, 155 BC, 1st c. BCE, beginning of the 7th c., or 3rd-5th century AC.These values represent the way most historians express absolute chronological dates of varying resolution, but they present several problems for the representation of dates as structured data. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "First, some of them are not fully quantified (what does beginning of the 7th c. mean in terms of calendar dates?).Second, the calendar being used is not specified.And third, the value in each cell is not represented in a standardized fashion u2013 some values include days and months, others only years, others only centuries.To illustrate this lack of standardization and the steps that can be taken to make dates machine-readable and thus suitable for visualization or reuse, we will use the hypothetical dataset of papyri below, which is structured to reflect the way many of us keep track of research data. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Sample rows in a database of papyri with a date field containing inconsistent natural-language temporal expressions.The first step necessary for standardization is the specification of a calendar.If the dates recorded in the dataset are in a non-Gregorian calendrical system, that system should be specified in the metadata that describes the spreadsheet columns, or in the date notation itself (e.g. AH for Anno Hegirae, the Hijri year in the Islamic calendar), or both. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "For an unambiguous reference, it is even better to include in the metadata a reference to an external defined vocabulary u2013 for example, the Getty AAT, which includes persistent unique identifiers for the major calendrical systems.1 Using one of these identifiers u2013 also known as Uniform Resource Identifiers, or URIs u2013 ensures that a future user of the data will know exactly what version of what calendrical system the database designer had in mind. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "This is especially important when a dataset's chronological attributes refer not to a calendrical system in common use, but to another system of reckoning u2013 for instance, the Julian Day system favored by astronomers, which involves a continuous count of days starting at noon from January 1, 4173 BCE, set by Joseph Scaliger as the starting-point of the Julian calendar (Grafton 1975), or more distant dates expressed in kilo-years (ky, ka) or mega-years (my, myr, mya) (that is, in thousands or millions of years before the present). Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "And it is even more important when conventional meanings have been adjusted in idiosyncratic ways in a particular dataset: for example, BP (before the present) always uses a present of 1950 when it is used in the context of radiocarbon dating, but in some other contexts the same notation has begun to assume a present of 2000.2The use of URIs does not only facilitate transparency; it can also enrich one's dataset by directing the user to additional information. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "For calendrical systems, this might come in the form of explanatory resources.At the level of individual dates, however, such additional information might also include other documents or objects that share that date.The Graph of Dated Objects and Texts (GODOT) project, for example, currently provides persistent identifiers for specific Roman consular and tribunician years, and will eventually provide URIs for a wide range of ancient date attestations.3 It is possible to look up year 5 of the reign of Trajan, in our hypothetical spreadsheet, in GODOT, and find three other documents related to this year. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "If we include the URI for that year (godot.dateid7aLvi4Xn9QbhdTJFYu5Sdm) in our spreadsheet and later share the data with an aggregation platform like Trismegistos (www.trismegistos.org), our document will be added to these four, providing a new attested date (the first of the month of Tubi).The proleptic Julian calendar (that is, the application of the Julian calendar to dates before the stabilization of the leap-year system in the early 1st c. CE) works well for ancient dates, but for digital purposes, it is generally preferable to express dates using the Gregorian calendar. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Date interoperability in digital environments depends heavily on the use of this calendar, which is now widely used for computing even in cultures with their own traditional calendars.The Gregorian calendar becomes proleptic when applied to dates before October 1582, or before its adoption in a particular region.The second step is thus the translation of dates in the original calendrical system to dates in the Gregorian calendar. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "For individual dates, there are now a number of useful online date converters,4 and while individual websites may become obsolete, it is very likely that such calculators will be available online for the foreseeable future.If dates after 1582 are involved, it is important to know when the Gregorian calendar was adopted in the place where the date in question was assigned (a document from the British colonies in North America dated to October 31, 1751, for example, would use the Julian calendar and would be dated to November 11, 1751 in the Gregorian calendar, since Britain did not adopt the Gregorian calendar until 1752). Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "It is also important to note the date of the new year in a given calendrical system, since many non-Gregorian calendars place this in the spring, summer, or fall, not at the beginning of January.5Absolute Time: FormattingOnce the dating system has been specified and Gregorian dates have been added, the next step toward interoperability is the standardization of the format for those dates.This is easier, because there is a commonly agreed-upon standard for representation. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The standard is ISO8601, established in 1988 by the International Standards Organization specifically for the numerical representation of dates and times, and most recently revised in 2004.6 The basic components of the ISO8601 standard are a four-digit Gregorian year, with BCE dates indicated by a leading minus-sign, followed by a two-digit Gregorian month, followed by a two-digit Gregorian day, with hyphens as separators (YYYY-MM-DD). Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The minimum element is the four-digit year, which the standard does not allow to be truncated, in order to avoid the Y2K problem.Notation may also be extended beyond the date to include 24-hour clock time in relation to UTC time.Two revisions to the standard after 1988 are especially significant for those who work with ancient-world data.First, while the original ISO8601 standard followed the Gregorian calendar in moving directly from 1 BCE to 1 CE, with no zero year, revised versions after 2000 have permitted a zero year to create a continuous number line. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "As a result, 1 BCE becomes 0000 in ISO8601 terms, 2 BCE becomes -0001, and so on.Second, while the insistence that years are represented by least four digits is unchanged, it is now permissible to express past or future years with more than four digits.The ISO8601 standard also provides a standard notation for temporal intervals, which are perhaps more common than single dates in ancient-world datasets. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "This notation takes the form <start date><end date>, where start and end dates are both expressed according to the standard.So in our hypothetical spreadsheet of papyri, we might take the value 4th-3rd c. BCE and represent it as -0398-0199, where -0398 is 399 BCE (the first year in the 4th century) and -0199 is 200 BCE (the last year in the 3rd).The date of an Egyptian papyrus signed on the first of the month of Tubi in the fifth year of the reign of Trajan can be represented as 0101-12-26 (that is, December 26, 101 CE, the proleptic Gregorian equivalent of that Egyptian month and Roman regnal year).7 The use of this standard representation of dates increases the potential for visualization, reuse, and aggregation of the dataset, even without any further Linked Data measures. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Tools are also emerging to facilitate the automated rendering of natural-language temporal expressions in ISO8601-compatible formats.8 On the other hand, the first representation implies a precision and a degree of certainty that may not have been present in the original statement: around the 4th or 3rd century BCE is not the same as between the precise dates of 399 and 200 BCE.The Library of Congress has recently addressed this problem with an extension to the ISO8601 standard, the Extended Date-Time Format (EDTF), which includes notations to express approximation, uncertainty, and missing information.9 It also permits the addition of the letter Y before the first numeral of a year with more than four digits, to avoid confusion (so the date 10001 would become -Y10000), and specifies ways to indicate precision with the annotation of significant digits.If the dataset was not created with a set format for dates, it may also be necessary to clean and standardize the existing date values before converting them to the ISO8601 standard. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "There are a number of tools available for database cleaning, but it is worth noting here the OpenRefine platform,10 for two reasons.First, it is a well-documented open source project that is both easy to learn and widely adopted, so it is likely to continue to be available for some time; and second, it allows the user to install reconciliation services that permit the matching of database values with values in external vocabularies. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "This is especially useful for the transformation of a temporal dataset into Linked Data: the URIs for the consular and tribunician dates in GODOT, for example, can be reconciled with a dataset containing such dates through an OpenRefine reconciliation service11 u2013 as can the period definitions in PeriodO, as we will see below.Absolute Time: Semantic RepresentationThe inclusion in a dataset of Gregorian dates represented according to the ISO8601 standard, perhaps using the conventions of the Library of Congress EDTF, makes the use of time more transparent, and makes it easier to combine that dataset with others that use the same standards. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "It is not, however, sufficient for the text-encoded markup representation of the dataset.Text-encoded markup means here that the dataset can be represented as a single plain-text file in which the structure of the dataset is explained in a human- and computer-readable format with reference to one or more ontologies andor metadata schemata, and in which the value in every cell of an original table is annotated with the metadata of the column that defined that value. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Since this representation does not encode information in tabular terms, with columns and rows, but treats each row as a complete item in itself, containing both attributes and their values, it is often referred to as a serialization.Serialization is a step toward the transformation of a dataset into a Linked Data format, but it is not the only step: at the most basic level, markup defines values in a dataset, not the relationships between them. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "For the latter, expression as subject-predicate-object triples is necessary.Since the metadata are defined relationally in a valid markup document, however, and since some of the same structures are used in Linked Data representations, it will be useful to begin with the representation of temporal data in Extensible Markup Language (XML).This is the language used by the Text Encoding Initiative, which has extensive participation from the Classics community (Dee, Foradi, and u0160ariu0107 2016) and by related ancient-world initiatives like EpiDoc (Cayless et al. 2009), so it is a particularly appropriate place to start in this context.12XML, like other metadata schemata, is based on a series of elements, conceptual terms that unambiguously identify different data types. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "An XML document generally includes a header element that specifies the schema it uses u2013 for example, the W3C recommended schema at <http:www.w3.org2001XMLSchema>.That schema has elements that describe particular kinds of temporal values: date for ISO8601 dates precise to the day, dateTime for the addition of clock time, gYear for Gregorian calendar year.13 So xs:gYear, a tag identifying an XML element, could be used to mark up the string -0398 to explain that the numbers refer to a Gregorian year according to the standards of the XML Schema. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The TEI standard extends this further with elements that can provide additional information about dates that are not expressed in the ISO8601 format, such as non-Gregorian calendar systems, termini post and ante quem (notBefore and notAfter), and named periods, to which we will return below.14 If our example dataset were being serialized in TEI-XML, for example, the value December 27, 101 CE in the proleptic Julian calendar could be expressed as <origDate when-custom=0101-12-27 datingMethod=#julian>December 27, 101 CE<origDate>, where the element origDate denotes the marked-up information as the date of origin of a document or object, the element when-custom specifies a date in a non-Gregorian calendar system, and datingMethod specifies the calendar system for that date by referring to an element defined elsewhere in the TEI-XML file.15 Further markup could be added to indicate additional attributes like degree of certainty.TEI-XML is a metadata schema specifically designed for texts, but ancient world datasets reflect material culture and art as well, and different types of data have different metadata requirements. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Other widely-used metadata schemata or ontologies also have elements that facilitate the structured representation of absolute time, and several of these are commonly used across other information fields, which can make it easier to connect data across disciplines.The most important are the Dublin Core metadata terms and the W3C OWL-Time Ontology.16 Both of these standards can be used to make explicit the treatment of temporal information in a document, but they serve different purposes. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "There are several Dublin Core metadata elements that deal with time, but the one of greatest relevance here is dcterms:temporal, which indicates that a value refers to the temporal characteristics of the resource it qualifies (rather than, for example, the time of a record's creation or a time-period that is the subject of a work).The Dublin Core specification is thus flexible but fairly non-specific. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The OWL-Time Ontology, on the other hand, provides a rich set of elements that allow complex temporal logic (as described by Allen 1984) to be expressed through the metadata associated with the values in a dataset.Where the Dublin Core temporal element might be a calendar date or a range of dates or a verbal expression of time, the OWL-Time Ontology uses specific elements to deal with different temporal datatypes (intervals vs. instants, for example) and structures. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Although it is helpful for working with Linked Data to have some knowledge of metadata and ontologies, for the purposes of this cookbook it may be enough simply to know what element should be used to name a given column in a spreadsheet.Using dcterms:temporal as a column header for object dates is a clearer expression of what the values in that column mean than just the term date, and it is easier to adapt to a Linked Data representation of the dataset.The sample table with natural-language temporal expressions identified as Dublin Core terms temporal values, and ISO8601-standard Gregorian-calendar temporal expressions identified as XML schema date values.Relative Time: PeriodsOur spreadsheet of papyri now has its original date column, with the original natural-language date expressions and the new label dcterms:temporal, and its additional column for standardized ISO8601 dates, now identified as xs:date values. A spreadsheet with this information could be fairly easily mapped to the EpiDoc standard and serialized for inclusion in an aggregation platform like papyri.info.17 But if it is like most spreadsheets related to the ancient world, a number of rows will have no absolute date values in any of these columns. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Instead, the date column u2013 or maybe a separate column called period or notes, as here u2013 might contain a relative chronological expression like Late Antique.This presents a greater challenge for interoperability and linking: what does this particular spreadsheet mean by Late Antique?Is it referring to a named date range, a stylistic quality, or something else altogether?And if it is referring to a named date range, what chronological and geographic boundaries are implied?One way to make this clear is by mapping a column of period terms to an ontology like OWL-Time (Cox and Richard 2015) or the simpler Dublin Core period datamodel,18 both of which make it possible to clearly explain the nature and boundaries of the temporal entities one is describing. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "There are other options more adapted to heritage disciplines: for example, the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model, or CRM, which has an extension for archaeology and which has paid particular attention to the modeling of temporal entities like periods (Doerr, Kritsotaki, and Stead 2010; Niccolucci and Hermon 2015b; 2015a).19 Ontological mapping may be beyond the capabilities of many of us who would nevertheless like to share our data, however, and in this case there is a simpler solution: the meaning of a term like Late Antique can be made explicit by connecting it to a definition in an external authority, like a thesaurus, a defined vocabulary, or a gazetteer, just as other temporal entities like calendar systems or dates can. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Other contributions to this cookbook will explain how to link other named entities like people or places to external references; the next part of this chapter will explain how to do so with periods.Relative Time: AlignmentLet us return to our spreadsheet.With absolute dates, preparation for a Linked Data representation was a matter of standardization of calendar and format according to shared conventions. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "With period terms, however, there is no internationally agreed-on, language-independent format or standard: while the underlying concept of a period term like Late Antiquity may be recognizable, each country, each discipline, each school of thought within a discipline understands its temporal boundaries somewhat differently, and some use other terms altogether to describe the same conceptual entity. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "One way to deal with this lack of standardization is to express clearly within a dataset what is meant by a specific term.After ontological mapping that makes it clear that the entity involved is a temporal period, an internal defined vocabulary with specified dates may be used to provide valid values for the period element.This is the way the Pleiades project, for example, organizes its references to periods, which appear as follows in the RDF+XML representation of Late Antique period in a specific place record. the place in question is attested in the historical record within a named timespan; the skos:Concept element refers to the Simple Knowledge Organization System datamodel, explaining that the named timespan is a conceptual object;20 and the rdf:about element points to a local defined vocabulary or thesaurus.21 In the Pleiades gazetteer, the definition of the period in time (and in some cases, though not here, in space) is contained in the period's name (AD 300-AD 640), and explained in more detail in the scope note.There is an additional piece of information here, however. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The owl:sameAs element indicates that the concept described by the value Late Antique in this record is the same concept as that described in another source u2013 in this case, in the PeriodO gazetteer of period definitions.This will become important for the discussion of the Linked Data representation of periodized information below, but at this stage it is worth pausing at the notion of an external vocabulary, because this is the second way that the meaning of a period term can be made explicit in a dataset. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Even if full ontological modeling is not possible for a given dataset or data manager, named entities can still be mapped to external vocabularies that have already carried out that descriptive work, and can serve as shared points of reference to help connect datasets that use different terms or concepts.Several of these external resources are available for temporal data.The most well-known is the Getty AAT, which maintains an extensive period vocabulary.22 Getty AAT identifiers for periods offer the advantage of a single conceptual representation for named entities that appear in idiosyncratic forms in individual sources. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "This advantage comes at the cost, however, of specific temporal boundaries: if Iron Age is to be a valid concept on a global level, it cannot be defined by dates that apply only in one place, so the only structured references to calendar time in the semantic representation of Iron Age in the Getty AAT refer to the creation and modification of the record itself.Temporal information about the period boundaries is expressed only in the note, which explains that the Iron Age developed at different times in various parts of the world, first appearing in the Middle East and southeastern Europe around 1,200 BCE, and in China around 600 BCE. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "In the Americas, it did not develop from the Bronze Age but was introduced to Stone Age cultures by European explorers.23 This definition works well for the explicit definition of the concept to which a dataset refers, but less well to identify the specific dates of the Iron Age in a particular place, which is likely to be closer to the way an ancient-world dataset uses the term (the Iron Age in Greece, the Iron Age in Britain, etc.).A emerging resource that resolves some of the tension between abstract concept and concrete boundaries is the chronOntology project of the German Archaeological Institute.24 This project uses the CIDOC-CRM to model periods as entities that are both conceptual and situated in time and space. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Like the Getty AAT, chronOntology provides URIs for periods, but because these entities are associated with both temporal and spatial boundaries, they make it easier to compare their duration with that of similar conceptual entities in other places (this comparison is further assisted by a timeline visualization of related concepts in the current interface). A search for the term Late Antique, for example, produces three unique, dated matches from the chronOntology dataset, which are distinguished by type (in terms of the domain where the temporal entity is used: politics, culture, material culture, architecture), source, andor date range.25 We might choose one of these as a definition for our own use of Late Antique in our spreadsheet, and we could add its URI to a new column in which the URI appears for every row where an item has already been classified as Late Antique. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The chronOntology platform has the added virtue of a union search across other period vocabularies u2013 specifically, the Getty AAT and the PeriodO gazetteer.Where the Getty AAT and the chronOntology dataset have attempted to unify period definitions under the smallest number of conceptual headings possible u2013 on the assumption that two different users are likely to have the same concept in mind when they apply the label Bronze Age, and different opinions on specific spatiotemporal bounds can be reconciled within a single concept u2013 the PeriodO gazetteer of period definitions has taken a different approach (Rabinowitz et al. 2016).26 Like the Getty AAT and chronOntology, it presents a semantic model for named conceptual entities and provides URIs for instances of those entities; but unlike those resources, its basic unit of analysis is a named period as defined in time and space by an individual authoritative source. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The Getty AAT provides a URI for the Iron Age in the most general sense of the term; chronOntology provides URIs for period concepts that seem to be broadly accepted in a particular region, and as a result includes far more information about spatial and temporal boundaries than the AAT.Both resources, however, focus on the abstract concept more than concrete usage, and therefore include period designations that lack specific coordinates in space or time or both.

    "Because PeriodO seeks to capture spatiotemporal usage rather than unified concepts, it only includes period definitions with coordinates in both space and time u2013 and because usage can vary from authority to authority even with reference to the same abstract concept in the same place, it sets no limit on the number of varying spatiotemporal definitions related to the same abstract concept.PeriodO is thus the most granular of the these three sources, and allows the most specific definition of the meaning of Late Antique in a given context: not the Getty AAT's broadest period in history and the style of art that developed after Severan rule in the Roman Empire, nor chronOntology's general definition for the Mediterranean as inferred from a particular publication, but Late Antique exactly as defined by the British Museum with respect to Greece, Cyprus, eastern Balkans, parts of the Caucasus (Georgia, Armenia, etc.), Asia Minor, Levant, Egypt and parts of Italy, in the original language and terms of the source (with the addition of an ISO8601 representation of the dates and an English translation of non-English labels).The sample table with the addition of a column for period URIs fromsource: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "one or more external thesauri or gazetteers, here populated with the British Museum definition of Late Antique as represented in the PeriodO gazetteer.In a serialization describing Late Antique? here as a period value, this URI could be further defined as owl sameAs or skos:closeMatch for that value.These period thesauri or gazetteers thus operate at different levels of specificity, and as a result have different uses. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "For datasets in which the primary concern for data-linking is to identify the use of a shared concept, rather than a definition used by any one scholar, national community, etc., the Getty AAT is probably the most valuable resource u2013 and certainly the simplest to search, since it will give the user one and only one Late Antique period.For datasets that require a greater degree of specificity about the type and coverage of a period concept, but not necessarily both spatial and chronological information, chronOntology offers both a union search and an API that can be exploited programmatically to extract period values according to specific search parameters. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Here, however, the parsing of the results requires more effort on the part of the user: a free-text search for Late Antique returns seven matches from the chronOntology thesaurus, three of which have different date-ranges.And in PeriodO, a free-text search for late antiqu* returns 23 different definitions of Late Antique and Late Antiquity, with 15 clearly distinct date-ranges across 16 distinct spatial areas, in nine different original languages from seven different authorities. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "This certainly helps the user develop a sense of the term's range of meanings, but it can make it more difficult to choose a specific definition from among them.29 To ease the matching of period definitions in PeriodO with named entities in a dataset, the project provides a reconciliation service that works with OpenRefine.30 This service allows the user to specify values in the existing data u2013 period labels, dates, spatial coverage, etc. u2013 that can be used to identify best matches from the PeriodO dataset. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Those matches are provided through the reconciliation service, and the user can add them to a new column in the data table.The process of matching concepts or terms in one dataset to those in another is generally referred to as alignment, and it is important for the representation of a given dataset as five-star Linked Open Data.Figure 1.Screenshot of OpenRefine reconciliation of example spreadsheet with PeriodO URIs, with the Pleiades definition of Late Antique selected.Relative Time: Semantic RepresentationThe stars in five-star Linked Open Data refer to a ranking system originally proposed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who has suggested that data on the semantic web could be assessed according to its degree of openness and interconnectivity (Berners-Lee 2010). Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "In the same post, he provides a succinct explanation of the transformation of a dataset like our hypothetical papyrus spreadsheet into Linked Data: The simplest way to make linked data is to use, in one file, a URI which points into another.Aligning the period terms in our spreadsheet to URIs for those terms in the Getty AAT, chronOntology, or PeriodO makes our temporal assertions more transparent and gives us an authoritative source for a date-range expressed in ISO8601-formatted dates. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "But when the data in that spreadsheet are mapped to a semantic-web datamodel like that of the Resource Description Format (RDF) (Heath and Bizer 2011) and expressed in that format or another serialization such as JSON-LD,31 the use of a URI from an external resource in connection with a value in the dataset makes it possible for that dataset to be connected to the broader web of Linked Data.To walk through Berners-Lee's five stars with our spreadsheet, we can acquire the first star simply by publishing a screenshot of the spreadsheet to the web under an open license; by making the original Excel spreadsheet itself available under an open license, we've already expressed the data in machine-readable structured form, which gets us a second star; and if we make that spreadsheet available in a non-proprietary format like CSV, we reach three stars. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The fourth star is awarded for the representation of the data as RDF or its equivalents, where the RDF datamodel and references to external, open, shared metadata schemata and ontologies explain what the data in the dataset mean.The final star is reached when the data themselves are connected through URI citations to other Linked Open Data datasets, creating the web of Linked Open Data.The inclusion of a period URI from a Linked Data source like the Getty AAT, chronOntology, or PeriodO in a periodized dataset thus prepares that dataset for connection to a wider world of periodized information. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "As more datasets make those connections, it will become easier to discover information from the same period or date-range across multiple heterogeneous datasets.The proof of this concept has been provided by the Pelagios project, which has used references to spatial gazetteers shared across various datasets to link, aggregate, and visualize spatial data in those datasets (Isaksen et al. 2014; Simon, Barker, and Isaksen 2012).32 Several ancient-world data standards now include specifications for the inclusion of periods as named entities in a serialized dataset. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "These specifications can be taken as models for the semantic representation of periods as Linked Data. I will describe three of them here: EpiDoc TEI-XML, the Pelagios Gazetteer Interchange Format, and the Linked Pasts Linked Places Format.The EpiDoc standard has already been cited for the expression of absolute dates.As authorities for periods as named entities have begun to appear, EpiDoc has been expanded to include this datatype. A period can be attached to an EpiDoc record according the following basic format, using the @period attribute and an external URI:t<origDate notBefore=0501 notAfter=0700 period=http:n2t.netark:99152p08m57hmdw6>Late Antique<origDate>In the origDate element, EpiDoc permits the addition of notations that specify the precision of the temporal boundaries with the @precision attribute (e.g. precision=medium) and the type of evidence on which the dating is based with the @evidence attribute (e.g. evidence=lettering). Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The specification also states that the period referenced need not correspond to the numerical date range offered, so that a given inscription can be associated with both its own absolute dates and a broader cultural or stylistic period.33The Pelagios Gazetteer Interchange Format (PGIF) was the format developed to connect places between different gazetteers in order to aggregate spatial data from the ancient world and to facilitate the creation of new Linked Data through semantic annotation platforms like Recogito.34 Because both the names and locations of places are time-dependent, this standard included ways to associate places with timespans. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Gazetteers published to Pelagios had to be represented as single RDF files.The @prefix values represent the prefix-namespace bindings that provide the metadata elements used in the representation, so @prefix dcterms: <http:purl.orgdcterms> points to the Dublin Core namespace, which identifies the meaning of the temporal attribute.That attribute is used here both for an absolute date range and for a reference to an external URI: in this case, a URI for a representation of the Epigraphic Database Heidelberg's Late Antiquity period in the PeriodO dataset. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Here the external identifier corresponds directly to the period vocabulary used internally, but unlike a simple textual label, it provides a stable reference and structured-data representation that makes it easier to align those temporal expressions with other datasets.Note that the date-range for the inscription is not identical to the date-range for the period: as in EpiDoc, an entity can have its own specific dates but also be described with a more general period reference.PGIF has now officially been superseded by the Linked Places Format developed by the Linked Pasts working group of Pelagios Commons, in close collaboration with the World Historical Gazetteer (the conceptual foundation for this format is described in Grossner, Janowicz, and Kessler 2016).35 Like the PGIF, the Linked Places standard focuses on interoperability between spatial datasets, but it makes time a much more central element; it relies, for example, on GeoJSON-T, a temporal extension to GeoJSON, which is a JSON standard used to describe space. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The Linked Places standard, expressed as JSON-LD, includes elements that describe the general properties of a temporal interval u2013 @start, @end, @earliest, @latest, @duration u2013 as well as @periods, an element that can be used to describe one or more named intervals associated with a place.The RDF ontology that underlies this standard makes extensive use of the OWL-Time ontology, which makes it possible to bound named intervals with other named intervals and to apply Allen's temporal logic to chronological relationships.36 The @earliest and @latest elements can be combined with the @start and @end elements, so that an interval may have an earliest and latest start andor an earliest and latest end, as in the four-part dates of the PeriodO and chronOntology datamodels. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "This structure is due in part to the interest of this ontology in events, which, like periods, are named entities with durations, but offer a finer degree of precision for temporal reasoning (Shaw, Troncy, and Hardman 2009).Temporal attributes in this ontology can be represented as follows, according to the JSON-LD example available in the Linked Pasts GitHub repository; The World Historical Gazetteer uses the Linked Pasts standard to describe the spatio-temporal, place-centered datasets that it integrates. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "It also offers a reconciliation service that allows users with relatively simple gazetteer data in the LD-TSV format to upload their datasets, validate the format of the dataset against the LD-TSV standard, and reconcile placenames with the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names and Wikidata, at which point the dataset can be accessioned by the World Historical Gazetteer for online publication.38 The LD-TSV format requires a start date in the ISO8601 format (with no zero year) for each place entry, and it allows an optional end date in the same format. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "This is a concrete demonstration of the value of date normalization and an easy way for scholars who wish to publish place-based datasets to transform their spreadsheets into Linked Data.To represent more temporally complex datasets, however, and especially datasets that contain both absolute dates and period terms, it is still necessary to use the full Linked Pasts JSON-LD specification.Files in this format, with the extension lpf, can also be uploaded, reconciled, and submitted through the data portal for incorporation in the World Historical Gazetteer. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Perhaps even more exciting is the development of a Linked Traces format that will use the W3C Web Annotation model to connect objects, people, events, concepts, and other phenomena that move across time and space.39Relative Time: Making New PeriodsAt this point, we have walked through the standardization and Linked Data representation of absolute calendar dates; we have discussed the alignment of relative dates expressed as named entities (periods) with Linked Data vocabularies, and the addition of URIs to a hypothetical dataset; and we have considered the serialized Linked Data representation of both absolute and relative temporal attributes in TEI-XML (the EpiDoc standard), RDFTTL (the Epigraphic Database Heidelberg), and JSON-LD (the Linked Places standard). Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "These steps toward the Linked Open Data publication of a dataset move along a scale of increasing complexity, at the most complex end of which is ontological mapping and the creation of new Linked Data vocabularies and schemata to represent the idiosyncrasies of a particular dataset.For some projects, it will be sufficient to format absolute time according to ISO8601 standards and map named temporal expressions to an external vocabulary like the Getty AAT, chronOntology, or PeriodO. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Other projects will have the resources to express their own defined period vocabulary as fully-formed Linked Data entities with their own URIs.But in some cases, a project will have a period vocabulary that does not align easily with any of the existing sources for period identifiers, but will lack the resources to create its own URIs and Linked Data representation for that vocabulary.These cases are a particular concern of the PeriodO project, which aims to become a repository for user-contributed period definitions as well as a curated dataset. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The project therefore incorporates a specific workflow for the addition of data by the user community.The PeriodO datamodel is built around two basic datatypes: statements that identify temporal and spatial boundaries for a period term according to a particular authoritative source (these were called definitions in the first version of the dataset; now they are labeled periods); and sets of definitions expressed by the same authoritative source (collections in the first version, now authorities). Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Users may contribute new periods to existing authorities (for example, if an ongoing digital project adds new period terms to its vocabulary), or they may contribute new authorities (a new set of period definitions from an authoritative source not already represented in the dataset, preferably differing from definitions already in the dataset in time, space, or name).The PeriodO data interface has recently been redesigned to incorporate better spatial and temporal visualizations, improve searching and browsing, and facilitate the creation of new authorities and periods by users.40 Instructions for the addition of new authorities and periods are available on the PeriodO project website41 and have been discussed in several publications (Rabinowitz et al. 2016; Rabinowitz, Shaw, and Golden 2018), but the following section will provide a brief overview of the process.Figure 2.

    "This will create a new dataset stored as a local Indexed Database in the browser cache.In some browsers, the user will be prompted to allow the client to use persistent storage, but in general, if the browser cache is cleared, the dataset will disappear, so it is advisable to navigate to the Settings page in the Data source menu to create a backup copy, in the form of a downloadable JSON file.When this new in-browser dataset is selected as a data source, it is blank by default; existing authorities can be added from the menu item Import changes, which will copy selected authorities or periods from another data source (e.g., the Canonical data source).

    "The import of the relevant information from the Canonical dataset is necessary if the user intends to make additions or changes to authorities or periods that have already been published in PeriodO, or to define new periods that are derived from existing definitions.To add new periods that are not associated with an existing authority in the Canonical dataset, the user must first create the authority in which those periods are defined. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "This can be done with the Add authority command in the Data source menu.An authority will usually be either a published source (a book, article, etc.) or an online project with some claim to expertise in a particular chronological context.If the source is a publication with a citation represented as Linked Data through WorldCat or CrossRef, entering a URL or DOI in the Most published sources tab will populate citation data automatically; otherwise, the user can manually enter citation data by clicking on the Other sources tab.

    "Publication information populated automatically in the first tab can also be edited or expanded in the second.Once the authority is created, the user can add period definitions by selecting the Add period item in the Authority menu.These definitions are added through a form that requires certain fields: an original label (in any language and script), a natural-language expression of spatial coverage as stated by the authority, and start and stop dates. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The original label, spatial coverage description, and startstop labels should all be expressed exactly as they appear in the source, in language, script, and wording, without any translation, editing, or parsing by the user.This is of central importance to the PeriodO model, which seeks to record definitions in their original form.The only required parsing is the expression of the start and stop dates as Gregorian years in ISO8601 format, in the Start year and Stop year fields. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "If one or both of these dates is a single year in a standard format (e.g. 200 or AD 10 or 250 CE), the interface will parse them automatically.If the dates are in non-standard formats or involve ranges, the user can deselect Parse dates automatically and carry out conversions to ISO8601 manually (note that PeriodO uses the ISO8601 standard that does include a year zero, so BCE dates will all add one year: e.g. 200 BC becomes -0199).

    "The current interface also makes it possible to provide additional semantic information about related periods: a period can be identified as a part of a broader period (e.g.Late Bronze Age is part of Bronze Age), or as a derivative of a period in another authority, to help chart chains of scholarly influence.Additional fields are available to record explanations of the definition offered by the source (Note) and any explanations related to the user's creation of the record (Editorial Note).

    "In the short term, clear indications of calendrical system, the standardization of dates and date formats, and the explanation of period terms with reference to internal or external vocabularies simply make it easier for others to understand and reuse a given dataset.As data publication becomes more prevalent, it is worth thinking about that hypothetical spreadsheet of papyri not just in terms of the research carried out by its creator, but in terms of its benefit to a larger community. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The more the creator can be transparent about the meanings of the datatypes a dataset contains, the more useful it will be to a broader audience.This is especially true when the creator of a dataset wishes to develop alternative or non-canonical vocabularies.Because of its focus on semantic information, the Linked Data ecosystem is inherently multivocal: if I have a simple way to explain exactly what I mean by a period term, I can be understood without having to use a conventional term from a defined vocabulary that may not fit my use case well.In the medium term, the semantic representation of period terms and the association of those terms with URIs in other datasets will make it easier to search across heterogeneous datasets by time. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "We can now use tools like the Peripleo browser to find information associated with a given ancient place across a variety of databases, even if they do not all call that place by the same name.If a similar Linked Data approach is adopted for periodized data, we will soon be able to search across datasets for items related to the Late Antique period, even when definitions of that period vary from database to database u2013 or, conversely, we will be able to search for items dated to the range 400-500 CE and find records like the papyrus in our hypothetical spreadsheet marked only as Late Antique. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Thus, not only will this approach to periodization make an individual dataset more transparent, but it will also make the records in that dataset more discoverable and easier to align and aggregate with other datasets.As an added benefit, it will also facilitate the digital visualization of the temporal distribution of items in a dataset: a URI that associates a period label like Late Antique with dates will allow records with that label to appear on a digital timeline.In the long term, the structured representation of periods in datasets related to the past will help us to understand our own scholarly disciplines. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Transparent references to the meaning of period terms will highlight the way that usage changes over time, as periodizations are revised or new periodizations are proposed.They will also highlight differences of opinion across scholarship and culture.These genealogical and discursive trends are a particular focus of PeriodO, which tracks derivative relationships across definitions in different authorities, and which is developing visualization tools to compare the spatiotemporal extents assigned to the same term by different scholars at different times.

    "Even more interesting is the possibility that structured temporal information expressed as Linked Open Data will provide training data for natural-language-processing approaches to text corpora.In this scenario, the transparent period definitions and date expressions in Linked Data datasets will be used to help machine-learning algorithms recognize and parse unstructured, opaque temporal references in texts.

Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Relative expressions of time of the sort used in natural language (after last week, during the Hellenistic period), on the other hand, cannot easily be converted into years, days, hours and minutes.Absolute and relative temporal data therefore require different modeling and offer different possibilities for aggregation and analysis.While absolute numeric values only need to be expressed in a consistent format to be legible for a computer, relative designations of time in a dataset require both normalization of human-readable terms (choosing to use either Late Roman or Late Antique, but not both) and additional parsing to enable absolute dating (stating the start and end dates of Late Roman in the context of a given dataset). Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Linked Data approaches make it possible to connect one's own terms with standard defined vocabularies u2013 dictionaries of appropriate terms u2013 like the Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), and they also permit connections with resources that specify absolute temporal boundaries for periods, like PeriodO or chronOntology.Projects seeking simply to normalize their temporal vocabularies might only need an external thesaurus, but projects interested in facilitating chronological search or visualization may also have to address the parsing of relative temporal terms in absolute time. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "It is therefore important to consider, at the beginning of a project, what kinds of temporal information will be included, how that data will be used by the project itself, and how it might be reused by others in the future.This chapter will begin by discussing standards, formats, and issues in the representation of absolute time, and then addresses the ways in which Linked Data approaches can enrich and connect relative temporal expressions on a semantic level as well. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The first sections will deal with calendrical systems and machine-readable date formats, while the following sections introduce the semantic representation of both absolute dates and the relative chronological concept of the period.The final section provides a brief guide to the creation of new referenceable period definitions in the PeriodO Linked Data gazetteer.Absolute Time: Calendar DatesOf course all expressions of time are relative to some extent, in that dates are expressed in relation to a particular point of reference. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Different points of reference account for different calendar systems.For the purposes of this chapter, however, absolute time refers to numeric dates expressed in any given calendar system, while relative temporal expressions are those that lack any inherent numeric dates.It is easier to standardize datasets in which chronological information is expressed in terms of absolute calendar dates, to ensure that this information can be consistently read and understood by both humans and computers. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Let us take as an example a spreadsheet listing Greco-Roman papyri that includes a column labeled date, containing heterogeneous absolute date values such as April 21, AD 565, 155 BC, 1st c. BCE, beginning of the 7th c., or 3rd-5th century AC.These values represent the way most historians express absolute chronological dates of varying resolution, but they present several problems for the representation of dates as structured data. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "First, some of them are not fully quantified (what does beginning of the 7th c. mean in terms of calendar dates?).Second, the calendar being used is not specified.And third, the value in each cell is not represented in a standardized fashion u2013 some values include days and months, others only years, others only centuries.To illustrate this lack of standardization and the steps that can be taken to make dates machine-readable and thus suitable for visualization or reuse, we will use the hypothetical dataset of papyri below, which is structured to reflect the way many of us keep track of research data. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Sample rows in a database of papyri with a date field containing inconsistent natural-language temporal expressions.The first step necessary for standardization is the specification of a calendar.If the dates recorded in the dataset are in a non-Gregorian calendrical system, that system should be specified in the metadata that describes the spreadsheet columns, or in the date notation itself (e.g. AH for Anno Hegirae, the Hijri year in the Islamic calendar), or both. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "For an unambiguous reference, it is even better to include in the metadata a reference to an external defined vocabulary u2013 for example, the Getty AAT, which includes persistent unique identifiers for the major calendrical systems.1 Using one of these identifiers u2013 also known as Uniform Resource Identifiers, or URIs u2013 ensures that a future user of the data will know exactly what version of what calendrical system the database designer had in mind. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "This is especially important when a dataset's chronological attributes refer not to a calendrical system in common use, but to another system of reckoning u2013 for instance, the Julian Day system favored by astronomers, which involves a continuous count of days starting at noon from January 1, 4173 BCE, set by Joseph Scaliger as the starting-point of the Julian calendar (Grafton 1975), or more distant dates expressed in kilo-years (ky, ka) or mega-years (my, myr, mya) (that is, in thousands or millions of years before the present). Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "And it is even more important when conventional meanings have been adjusted in idiosyncratic ways in a particular dataset: for example, BP (before the present) always uses a present of 1950 when it is used in the context of radiocarbon dating, but in some other contexts the same notation has begun to assume a present of 2000.2The use of URIs does not only facilitate transparency; it can also enrich one's dataset by directing the user to additional information. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "For calendrical systems, this might come in the form of explanatory resources.At the level of individual dates, however, such additional information might also include other documents or objects that share that date.The Graph of Dated Objects and Texts (GODOT) project, for example, currently provides persistent identifiers for specific Roman consular and tribunician years, and will eventually provide URIs for a wide range of ancient date attestations.3 It is possible to look up year 5 of the reign of Trajan, in our hypothetical spreadsheet, in GODOT, and find three other documents related to this year.

    "If we include the URI for that year (https:godot.dateid7aLvi4Xn9QbhdTJFYu5Sdm) in our spreadsheet and later share the data with an aggregation platform like Trismegistos (Www.trismegistos.org), our document will be added to these four, providing a new attested date (the first of the month of Tubi). GODOT also provides a useful tool for conversion of ancient dates to the proleptic Julian and Gregorian calendars, allowing us to parse the date in our spreadsheet as December 27 (Julian) or December 26 (Gregorian), 101 CE.The same table as the previous, with a Uniform Resource Identifier from GODOT for the regnal year of Trajan and a conversion to the proleptic Gregorian calendar added to the document in the first row.The proleptic Julian calendar (that is, the application of the Julian calendar to dates before the stabilization of the leap-year system in the early 1st c. CE) works well for ancient dates, but for digital purposes, it is generally preferable to express dates using the Gregorian calendar. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Date interoperability in digital environments depends heavily on the use of this calendar, which is now widely used for computing even in cultures with their own traditional calendars.The Gregorian calendar becomes proleptic when applied to dates before October 1582, or before its adoption in a particular region.The second step is thus the translation of dates in the original calendrical system to dates in the Gregorian calendar. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "For individual dates, there are now a number of useful online date converters,4 and while individual websites may become obsolete, it is very likely that such calculators will be available online for the foreseeable future.If dates after 1582 are involved, it is important to know when the Gregorian calendar was adopted in the place where the date in question was assigned (a document from the British colonies in North America dated to October 31, 1751, for example, would use the Julian calendar and would be dated to November 11, 1751 in the Gregorian calendar, since Britain did not adopt the Gregorian calendar until 1752).

    "It is also important to note the date of the new year in a given calendrical system, since many non-Gregorian calendars place this in the spring, summer, or fall, not at the beginning of January.5Absolute Time: FormattingOnce the dating system has been specified and Gregorian dates have been added, the next step toward interoperability is the standardization of the format for those dates.This is easier, because there is a commonly agreed-upon standard for representation. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The standard is ISO8601, established in 1988 by the International Standards Organization specifically for the numerical representation of dates and times, and most recently revised in 2004.6 The basic components of the ISO8601 standard are a four-digit Gregorian year, with BCE dates indicated by a leading minus-sign, followed by a two-digit Gregorian month, followed by a two-digit Gregorian day, with hyphens as separators (YYYY-MM-DD). Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The minimum element is the four-digit year, which the standard does not allow to be truncated, in order to avoid the Y2K problem.Notation may also be extended beyond the date to include 24-hour clock time in relation to UTC time.Two revisions to the standard after 1988 are especially significant for those who work with ancient-world data.First, while the original ISO8601 standard followed the Gregorian calendar in moving directly from 1 BCE to 1 CE, with no zero year, revised versions after 2000 have permitted a zero year to create a continuous number line. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "As a result, 1 BCE becomes 0000 in ISO8601 terms, 2 BCE becomes -0001, and so on.Second, while the insistence that years are represented by least four digits is unchanged, it is now permissible to express past or future years with more than four digits.The ISO8601 standard also provides a standard notation for temporal intervals, which are perhaps more common than single dates in ancient-world datasets. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The same table as the previous, but now with a column for Gregorian dates expressed in a normalized form according to the ISO8601 standard.So in our hypothetical spreadsheet of papyri, we might take the value 4th-3rd c. BCE and represent it as -0398-0199, where -0398 is 399 BCE (the first year in the 4th century) and -0199 is 200 BCE (the last year in the 3rd).The date of an Egyptian papyrus signed on the first of the month of Tubi in the fifth year of the reign of Trajan can be represented as 0101-12-26 (that is, December 26, 101 CE, the proleptic Gregorian equivalent of that Egyptian month and Roman regnal year).7 The use of this standard representation of dates increases the potential for visualization, reuse, and aggregation of the dataset, even without any further Linked Data measures. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Tools are also emerging to facilitate the automated rendering of natural-language temporal expressions in ISO8601-compatible formats.8 On the other hand, the first representation implies a precision and a degree of certainty that may not have been present in the original statement: around the 4th or 3rd century BCE is not the same as between the precise dates of 399 and 200 BCE.The Library of Congress has recently addressed this problem with an extension to the ISO8601 standard, the Extended Date-Time Format (EDTF), which includes notations to express approximation, uncertainty, and missing information.9 It also permits the addition of the letter Y before the first numeral of a year with more than four digits, to avoid confusion (so the date 10001 would become -Y10000), and specifies ways to indicate precision with the annotation of significant digits.If the dataset was not created with a set format for dates, it may also be necessary to clean and standardize the existing date values before converting them to the ISO8601 standard.

    "There are a number of tools available for database cleaning, but it is worth noting here the OpenRefine platform,10 for two reasons.First, it is a well-documented open source project that is both easy to learn and widely adopted, so it is likely to continue to be available for some time; and second, it allows the user to install reconciliation services that permit the matching of database values with values in external vocabularies. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "This is especially useful for the transformation of a temporal dataset into Linked Data: the URIs for the consular and tribunician dates in GODOT, for example, can be reconciled with a dataset containing such dates through an OpenRefine reconciliation service11 u2013 as can the period definitions in PeriodO, as we will see below.Absolute Time: Semantic RepresentationThe inclusion in a dataset of Gregorian dates represented according to the ISO8601 standard, perhaps using the conventions of the Library of Congress EDTF, makes the use of time more transparent, and makes it easier to combine that dataset with others that use the same standards.

    "It is not, however, sufficient for the text-encoded markup representation of the dataset.Text-encoded markup means here that the dataset can be represented as a single plain-text file in which the structure of the dataset is explained in a human- and computer-readable format with reference to one or more ontologies andor metadata schemata, and in which the value in every cell of an original table is annotated with the metadata of the column that defined that value. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Since this representation does not encode information in tabular terms, with columns and rows, but treats each row as a complete item in itself, containing both attributes and their values, it is often referred to as a serialization.Serialization is a step toward the transformation of a dataset into a Linked Data format, but it is not the only step: at the most basic level, markup defines values in a dataset, not the relationships between them. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "For the latter, expression as subject-predicate-object triples is necessary.Since the metadata are defined relationally in a valid markup document, however, and since some of the same structures are used in Linked Data representations, it will be useful to begin with the representation of temporal data in Extensible Markup Language (XML).This is the language used by the Text Encoding Initiative, which has extensive participation from the Classics community (Dee, Foradi, and u0160ariu0107 2016) and by related ancient-world initiatives like EpiDoc (Cayless et al. 2009), so it is a particularly appropriate place to start in this context.12XML, like other metadata schemata, is based on a series of elements, conceptual terms that unambiguously identify different data types. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "An XML document generally includes a header element that specifies the schema it uses u2013 for example, the W3C recommended schema at <http:www.w3.org2001XMLSchema>.That schema has elements that describe particular kinds of temporal values: date for ISO8601 dates precise to the day, dateTime for the addition of clock time, gYear for Gregorian calendar year.13 So xs:gYear, a tag identifying an XML element, could be used to mark up the string -0398 to explain that the numbers refer to a Gregorian year according to the standards of the XML Schema. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The TEI standard extends this further with elements that can provide additional information about dates that are not expressed in the ISO8601 format, such as non-Gregorian calendar systems, termini post and ante quem (notBefore and notAfter), and named periods, to which we will return below.14 If our example dataset were being serialized in TEI-XML, for example, the value December 27, 101 CE in the proleptic Julian calendar could be expressed as <origDate when-custom=0101-12-27 datingMethod=#julian>December 27, 101 CE<origDate>, where the element origDate denotes the marked-up information as the date of origin of a document or object, the element when-custom specifies a date in a non-Gregorian calendar system, and datingMethod specifies the calendar system for that date by referring to an element defined elsewhere in the TEI-XML file.15 Further markup could be added to indicate additional attributes like degree of certainty.TEI-XML is a metadata schema specifically designed for texts, but ancient world datasets reflect material culture and art as well, and different types of data have different metadata requirements. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Other widely-used metadata schemata or ontologies also have elements that facilitate the structured representation of absolute time, and several of these are commonly used across other information fields, which can make it easier to connect data across disciplines.The most important are the Dublin Core metadata terms and the W3C OWL-Time Ontology.16 Both of these standards can be used to make explicit the treatment of temporal information in a document, but they serve different purposes. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "There are several Dublin Core metadata elements that deal with time, but the one of greatest relevance here is dcterms:temporal, which indicates that a value refers to the temporal characteristics of the resource it qualifies (rather than, for example, the time of a record's creation or a time-period that is the subject of a work).The Dublin Core specification is thus flexible but fairly non-specific. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The OWL-Time Ontology, on the other hand, provides a rich set of elements that allow complex temporal logic (as described by Allen 1984) to be expressed through the metadata associated with the values in a dataset.Where the Dublin Core temporal element might be a calendar date or a range of dates or a verbal expression of time, the OWL-Time Ontology uses specific elements to deal with different temporal datatypes (intervals vs. instants, for example) and structures. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Although it is helpful for working with Linked Data to have some knowledge of metadata and ontologies, for the purposes of this cookbook it may be enough simply to know what element should be used to name a given column in a spreadsheet.Using dcterms:temporal as a column header for object dates is a clearer expression of what the values in that column mean than just the term date, and it is easier to adapt to a Linked Data representation of the dataset.The sample table with natural-language temporal expressions identified as Dublin Core terms temporal values, and ISO8601-standard Gregorian-calendar temporal expressions identified as XML schema date values.Relative Time: PeriodsOur spreadsheet of papyri now has its original date column, with the original natural-language date expressions and the new label dcterms:temporal, and its additional column for standardized ISO8601 dates, now identified as xs:date values. A spreadsheet with this information could be fairly easily mapped to the EpiDoc standard and serialized for inclusion in an aggregation platform like papyri.info.17 But if it is like most spreadsheets related to the ancient world, a number of rows will have no absolute date values in any of these columns. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Instead, the date column u2013 or maybe a separate column called period or notes, as here u2013 might contain a relative chronological expression like Late Antique.This presents a greater challenge for interoperability and linking: what does this particular spreadsheet mean by Late Antique?Is it referring to a named date range, a stylistic quality, or something else altogether?And if it is referring to a named date range, what chronological and geographic boundaries are implied?One way to make this clear is by mapping a column of period terms to an ontology like OWL-Time (Cox and Richard 2015) or the simpler Dublin Core period datamodel,18 both of which make it possible to clearly explain the nature and boundaries of the temporal entities one is describing. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "There are other options more adapted to heritage disciplines: for example, the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model, or CRM, which has an extension for archaeology and which has paid particular attention to the modeling of temporal entities like periods (Doerr, Kritsotaki, and Stead 2010; Niccolucci and Hermon 2015b; 2015a).19 Ontological mapping may be beyond the capabilities of many of us who would nevertheless like to share our data, however, and in this case there is a simpler solution: the meaning of a term like Late Antique can be made explicit by connecting it to a definition in an external authority, like a thesaurus, a defined vocabulary, or a gazetteer, just as other temporal entities like calendar systems or dates can.

    "Other contributions to this cookbook will explain how to link other named entities like people or places to external references; the next part of this chapter will explain how to do so with periods.Relative Time: AlignmentLet us return to our spreadsheet.With absolute dates, preparation for a Linked Data representation was a matter of standardization of calendar and format according to shared conventions. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "With period terms, however, there is no internationally agreed-on, language-independent format or standard: while the underlying concept of a period term like Late Antiquity may be recognizable, each country, each discipline, each school of thought within a discipline understands its temporal boundaries somewhat differently, and some use other terms altogether to describe the same conceptual entity. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "One way to deal with this lack of standardization is to express clearly within a dataset what is meant by a specific term.After ontological mapping that makes it clear that the entity involved is a temporal period, an internal defined vocabulary with specified dates may be used to provide valid values for the period element.This is the way the Pleiades project, for example, organizes its references to periods, which appear as follows in the RDF+XML representation of Late Antique period in a specific place record: This will become important for the discussion of the Linked Data representation of periodized information below, but at this stage it is worth pausing at the notion of an external vocabulary, because this is the second way that the meaning of a period term can be made explicit in a dataset. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Even if full ontological modeling is not possible for a given dataset or data manager, named entities can still be mapped to external vocabularies that have already carried out that descriptive work, and can serve as shared points of reference to help connect datasets that use different terms or concepts.Several of these external resources are available for temporal data.The most well-known is the Getty AAT, which maintains an extensive period vocabulary.22 Getty AAT identifiers for periods offer the advantage of a single conceptual representation for named entities that appear in idiosyncratic forms in individual sources. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "This advantage comes at the cost, however, of specific temporal boundaries: if Iron Age is to be a valid concept on a global level, it cannot be defined by dates that apply only in one place, so the only structured references to calendar time in the semantic representation of Iron Age in the Getty AAT refer to the creation and modification of the record itself.Temporal information about the period boundaries is expressed only in the note, which explains that the Iron Age developed at different times in various parts of the world, first appearing in the Middle East and southeastern Europe around 1,200 BCE, and in China around 600 BCE. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "In the Americas, it did not develop from the Bronze Age but was introduced to Stone Age cultures by European explorers.23 This definition works well for the explicit definition of the concept to which a dataset refers, but less well to identify the specific dates of the Iron Age in a particular place, which is likely to be closer to the way an ancient-world dataset uses the term (the Iron Age in Greece, the Iron Age in Britain, etc.).A emerging resource that resolves some of the tension between abstract concept and concrete boundaries is the chronOntology project of the German Archaeological Institute.24 This project uses the CIDOC-CRM to model periods as entities that are both conceptual and situated in time and space. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Like the Getty AAT, chronOntology provides URIs for periods, but because these entities are associated with both temporal and spatial boundaries, they make it easier to compare their duration with that of similar conceptual entities in other places (this comparison is further assisted by a timeline visualization of related concepts in the current interface). A search for the term Late Antique, for example, produces three unique, dated matches from the chronOntology dataset, which are distinguished by type (in terms of the domain where the temporal entity is used: politics, culture, material culture, architecture), source, andor date range.25 We might choose one of these as a definition for our own use of Late Antique in our spreadsheet, and we could add its URI to a new column in which the URI appears for every row where an item has already been classified as Late Antique. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The chronOntology platform has the added virtue of a union search across other period vocabularies u2013 specifically, the Getty AAT and the PeriodO gazetteer.Where the Getty AAT and the chronOntology dataset have attempted to unify period definitions under the smallest number of conceptual headings possible u2013 on the assumption that two different users are likely to have the same concept in mind when they apply the label Bronze Age, and different opinions on specific spatiotemporal bounds can be reconciled within a single concept u2013 the PeriodO gazetteer of period definitions has taken a different approach (Rabinowitz et al. 2016).26 Like the Getty AAT and chronOntology, it presents a semantic model for named conceptual entities and provides URIs for instances of those entities; but unlike those resources, its basic unit of analysis is a named period as defined in time and space by an individual authoritative source. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The Getty AAT provides a URI for the Iron Age in the most general sense of the term; chronOntology provides URIs for period concepts that seem to be broadly accepted in a particular region, and as a result includes far more information about spatial and temporal boundaries than the AAT.Both resources, however, focus on the abstract concept more than concrete usage, and therefore include period designations that lack specific coordinates in space or time or both. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Because PeriodO seeks to capture spatiotemporal usage rather than unified concepts, it only includes period definitions with coordinates in both space and time u2013 and because usage can vary from authority to authority even with reference to the same abstract concept in the same place, it sets no limit on the number of varying spatiotemporal definitions related to the same abstract concept.PeriodO is thus the most granular of the these three sources, and allows the most specific definition of the meaning of Late Antique in a given context: not the Getty AAT's broadest period in history and the style of art that developed after Severan rule in the Roman Empire, nor chronOntology's general definition for the Mediterranean as inferred from a particular publication, but Late Antique exactly as defined by the British Museum with respect to Greece, Cyprus, eastern Balkans, parts of the Caucasus (Georgia, Armenia, etc.), Asia Minor, Levant, Egypt and parts of Italy, in the original language and terms of the source (with the addition of an ISO8601 representation of the dates and an English translation of non-English labels).27 Like chronOntology, PeriodO uses four-part date ranges (earliestsource: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "start, latest start, earliest stop, latest stop) to express temporal period boundaries that are themselves intervals, parsing the original natural-language temporal expressions where intent is clear.The sample table with the addition of a column for period URIs from one or more external thesauri or gazetteers, here populated with the British Museum definition of Late Antique as represented in the PeriodO gazetteer.

    "In a serialization describing Late Antique? here as a period value, this URI could be further defined as owl:sameAs or skos:closeMatch for that value.These period thesauri or gazetteers thus operate at different levels of specificity, and as a result have different uses.For datasets in which the primary concern for data-linking is to identify the use of a shared concept, rather than a definition used by any one scholar, national community, etc., the Getty AAT is probably the most valuable resource u2013 and certainly the simplest to search, since it will give the user one and only one Late Antique period. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "For datasets that require a greater degree of specificity about the type and coverage of a period concept, but not necessarily both spatial and chronological information, chronOntology offers both a union search and an API that can be exploited programmatically to extract period values according to specific search parameters.Here, however, the parsing of the results requires more effort on the part of the user: a free-text search for Late Antique returns seven matches from the chronOntology thesaurus, three of which have different date-ranges. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "And in PeriodO, a free-text search for late antiqu* returns 23 different definitions of Late Antique and Late Antiquity, with 15 clearly distinct date-ranges across 16 distinct spatial areas, in nine different original languages from seven different authorities.This certainly helps the user develop a sense of the term's range of meanings, but it can make it more difficult to choose a specific definition from among them.29 To ease the matching of period definitions in PeriodO with named entities in a dataset, the project provides a reconciliation service that works with OpenRefine.30 This service allows the user to specify values in the existing data u2013 period labels, dates, spatial coverage, etc. u2013 that can be used to identify best matches from the PeriodO dataset. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Those matches are provided through the reconciliation service, and the user can add them to a new column in the data table.The process of matching concepts or terms in one dataset to those in another is generally referred to as alignment, and it is important for the representation of a given dataset as five-star Linked Open Data.Figure 1.Screenshot of OpenRefine reconciliation of example spreadsheet with PeriodO URIs, with the Pleiades definition of Late Antique selected.Relative Time: Semantic RepresentationThe stars in five-star Linked Open Data refer to a ranking system originally proposed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who has suggested that data on the semantic web could be assessed according to its degree of openness and interconnectivity (Berners-Lee 2010). Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "In the same post, he provides a succinct explanation of the transformation of a dataset like our hypothetical papyrus spreadsheet into Linked Data: The simplest way to make linked data is to use, in one file, a URI which points into another.Aligning the period terms in our spreadsheet to URIs for those terms in the Getty AAT, chronOntology, or PeriodO makes our temporal assertions more transparent and gives us an authoritative source for a date-range expressed in ISO8601-formatted dates. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "But when the data in that spreadsheet are mapped to a semantic-web datamodel like that of the Resource Description Format (RDF) (Heath and Bizer 2011) and expressed in that format or another serialization such as JSON-LD,31 the use of a URI from an external resource in connection with a value in the dataset makes it possible for that dataset to be connected to the broader web of Linked Data.To walk through Berners-Lee's five stars with our spreadsheet, we can acquire the first star simply by publishing a screenshot of the spreadsheet to the web under an open license; by making the original Excel spreadsheet itself available under an open license, we've already expressed the data in machine-readable structured form, which gets us a second star; and if we make that spreadsheet available in a non-proprietary format like CSV, we reach three stars. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The fourth star is awarded for the representation of the data as RDF or its equivalents, where the RDF datamodel and references to external, open, shared metadata schemata and ontologies explain what the data in the dataset mean.The final star is reached when the data themselves are connected through URI citations to other Linked Open Data datasets, creating the web of Linked Open Data.The inclusion of a period URI from a Linked Data source like the Getty AAT, chronOntology, or PeriodO in a periodized dataset thus prepares that dataset for connection to a wider world of periodized information.

    "As more datasets make those connections, it will become easier to discover information from the same period or date-range across multiple heterogeneous datasets.The proof of this concept has been provided by the Pelagios project, which has used references to spatial gazetteers shared across various datasets to link, aggregate, and visualize spatial data in those datasets (Isaksen et al. 2014; Simon, Barker, and Isaksen 2012).32 Several ancient-world data standards now include specifications for the inclusion of periods as named entities in a serialized dataset.

    "The specification also states that the period referenced need not correspond to the numerical date range offered, so that a given inscription can be associated with both its own absolute dates and a broader cultural or stylistic period.33The Pelagios Gazetteer Interchange Format (PGIF) was the format developed to connect places between different gazetteers in order to aggregate spatial data from the ancient world and to facilitate the creation of new Linked Data through semantic annotation platforms like Recogito.34 Because both the names and locations of places are time-dependent, this standard included ways to associate places with timespans. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Gazetteers published to Pelagios had to be represented as single RDF files.Within those files, references to calendar dates and periods were formatted as follows (example from the TTLN3 representation of the Epigraphic Database Heidelberg):t  @t    dcterms:language la .The @prefix values represent the prefix-namespace bindings that provide the metadata elements used in the representation, so @prefix dcterms: <http:purl.orgdcterms> points to the Dublin Core namespace, which identifies the meaning of the temporal attribute. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "That attribute is used here both for an absolute date range and for a reference to an external URI: in this case, a URI for a representation of the Epigraphic Database Heidelberg's Late Antiquity period in the PeriodO dataset.Here the external identifier corresponds directly to the period vocabulary used internally, but unlike a simple textual label, it provides a stable reference and structured-data representation that makes it easier to align those temporal expressions with other datasets. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Note that the date-range for the inscription is not identical to the date-range for the period: as in EpiDoc, an entity can have its own specific dates but also be described with a more general period reference.PGIF has now officially been superseded by the Linked Places Format developed by the Linked Pasts working group of Pelagios Commons, in close collaboration with the World Historical Gazetteer (the conceptual foundation for this format is described in Grossner, Janowicz, and Kessler 2016).35 Like the PGIF, the Linked Places standard focuses on interoperability between spatial datasets, but it makes time a much more central element; it relies, for example, on GeoJSON-T, a temporal extension to GeoJSON, which is a JSON standard used to describe space. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The Linked Places standard, expressed as JSON-LD, includes elements that describe the general properties of a temporal interval u2013 @start, @end, @earliest, @latest, @duration u2013 as well as @periods, an element that can be used to describe one or more named intervals associated with a place.The RDF ontology that underlies this standard makes extensive use of the OWL-Time ontology, which makes it possible to bound named intervals with other named intervals and to apply Allen's temporal logic to chronological relationships.36 The @earliest and @latest elements can be combined with the @start and @end elements, so that an interval may have an earliest and latest start andor an earliest and latest end, as in the four-part dates of the PeriodO and chronOntology datamodels. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "This structure is due in part to the interest of this ontology in events, which, like periods, are named entities with durations, but offer a finer degree of precision for temporal reasoning (Shaw, Troncy, and Hardman 2009).Temporal attributes in this ontology can be represented as follows, according to the JSON-LD example available in the Linked Pasts GitHub repository; This describes an object with temporal attributes including a start in 210 CE, an end in 400 CE, and a duration of 190 years, as well as an association with the PeriodO URI http:n2t.netark:99152p0jrrjb67vs, which refers to the definition of Late Antiquity used by the Epigraphic Database Heidelberg.The World Historical Gazetteer uses the Linked Pasts standard to describe the spatio-temporal, place-centered datasets that it integrates.

    "It also offers a reconciliation service that allows users with relatively simple gazetteer data in the LD-TSV format to upload their datasets, validate the format of the dataset against the LD-TSV standard, and reconcile placenames with the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names and Wikidata, at which point the dataset can be accessioned by the World Historical Gazetteer for online publication.38 The LD-TSV format requires a start date in the ISO8601 format (with no zero year) for each place entry, and it allows an optional end date in the same format.

    "This is a concrete demonstration of the value of date normalization and an easy way for scholars who wish to publish place-based datasets to transform their spreadsheets into Linked Data.To represent more temporally complex datasets, however, and especially datasets that contain both absolute dates and period terms, it is still necessary to use the full Linked Pasts JSON-LD specification.Files in this format, with the extension lpf, can also be uploaded, reconciled, and submitted through the data portal for incorporation in the World Historical Gazetteer.

    "Perhaps even more exciting is the development of a Linked Traces format that will use the W3C Web Annotation model to connect objects, people, events, concepts, and other phenomena that move across time and space.39Relative Time: Making New PeriodsAt this point, we have walked through the standardization and Linked Data representation of absolute calendar dates; we have discussed the alignment of relative dates expressed as named entities (periods) with Linked Data vocabularies, and the addition of URIs to a hypothetical dataset; and we have considered the serialized Linked Data representation of both absolute and relative temporal attributes in TEI-XML (the EpiDoc standard), RDFTTL (the Epigraphic Database Heidelberg), and JSON-LD (the Linked Places standard).

    "These steps toward the Linked Open Data publication of a dataset move along a scale of increasing complexity, at the most complex end of which is ontological mapping and the creation of new Linked Data vocabularies and schemata to represent the idiosyncrasies of a particular dataset.For some projects, it will be sufficient to format absolute time according to ISO8601 standards and map named temporal expressions to an external vocabulary like the Getty AAT, chronOntology, or PeriodO. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Other projects will have the resources to express their own defined period vocabulary as fully-formed Linked Data entities with their own URIs.But in some cases, a project will have a period vocabulary that does not align easily with any of the existing sources for period identifiers, but will lack the resources to create its own URIs and Linked Data representation for that vocabulary.These cases are a particular concern of the PeriodO project, which aims to become a repository for user-contributed period definitions as well as a curated dataset. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The project therefore incorporates a specific workflow for the addition of data by the user community.The PeriodO datamodel is built around two basic datatypes: statements that identify temporal and spatial boundaries for a period term according to a particular authoritative source (these were called definitions in the first version of the dataset; now they are labeled periods); and sets of definitions expressed by the same authoritative source (collections in the first version, now authorities).

    "Users may contribute new periods to existing authorities (for example, if an ongoing digital project adds new period terms to its vocabulary), or they may contribute new authorities (a new set of period definitions from an authoritative source not already represented in the dataset, preferably differing from definitions already in the dataset in time, space, or name).The PeriodO data interface has recently been redesigned to incorporate better spatial and temporal visualizations, improve searching and browsing, and facilitate the creation of new authorities and periods by users.40 Instructions for the addition of new authorities and periods are available on the PeriodO project website41 and have been discussed in several publications (Rabinowitz et al. 2016; Rabinowitz, Shaw, and Golden 2018), but the following section will provide a brief overview of the process.Figure 2.

Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "This will create a new dataset stored as a local Indexed Database in the browser cache.In some browsers, the user will be prompted to allow the client to use persistent storage, but in general, if the browser cache is cleared, the dataset will disappear, so it is advisable to navigate to the Settings page in the Data source menu to create a backup copy, in the form of a downloadable JSON file.When this new in-browser dataset is selected as a data source, it is blank by default; existing authorities can be added from the menu item Import changes, which will copy selected authorities or periods from another data source (e.g., the Canonical data source).

    "The import of the relevant information from the Canonical dataset is necessary if the user intends to make additions or changes to authorities or periods that have already been published in PeriodO, or to define new periods that are derived from existing definitions.To add new periods that are not associated with an existing authority in the Canonical dataset, the user must first create the authority in which those periods are defined. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "This can be done with the Add authority command in the Data source menu.An authority will usually be either a published source (a book, article, etc.) or an online project with some claim to expertise in a particular chronological context.If the source is a publication with a citation represented as Linked Data through WorldCat or CrossRef, entering a URL or DOI in the Most published sources tab will populate citation data automatically; otherwise, the user can manually enter citation data by clicking on the Other sources tab.

    "Publication information populated automatically in the first tab can also be edited or expanded in the second.Once the authority is created, the user can add period definitions by selecting the Add period item in the Authority menu.These definitions are added through a form that requires certain fields: an original label (in any language and script), a natural-language expression of spatial coverage as stated by the authority, and start and stop dates. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The original label, spatial coverage description, and startstop labels should all be expressed exactly as they appear in the source, in language, script, and wording, without any translation, editing, or parsing by the user.This is of central importance to the PeriodO model, which seeks to record definitions in their original form.The only required parsing is the expression of the start and stop dates as Gregorian years in ISO8601 format, in the Start year and Stop year fields.

    "If one or both of these dates is a single year in a standard format (e.g. 200 or AD 10 or 250 CE), the interface will parse them automatically.If the dates are in non-standard formats or involve ranges, the user can deselect Parse dates automatically and carry out conversions to ISO8601 manually (note that PeriodO uses the ISO8601 standard that does include a year zero, so BCE dates will all add one year: e.g. 200 BC becomes -0199).

    "The current interface also makes it possible to provide additional semantic information about related periods: a period can be identified as a part of a broader period (e.g.Late Bronze Age is part of Bronze Age), or as a derivative of a period in another authority, to help chart chains of scholarly influence.Additional fields are available to record explanations of the definition offered by the source (Note) and any explanations related to the user's creation of the record (Editorial Note).

    "After choosing the data source to which the changes should be submitted (to add to the public PeriodO dataset, the source should be Canonical), the user is prompted to select which new or modified authorities or periods should be included in the patch.Submitted patches are reviewed and accepted or rejected by the PeriodO editors.When a patch is accepted, new authorities andor periods are added to the canonical dataset and receive URIs in the form of ARK IDs.

    "The HTTP URIs resolve to the individual authorities and periods using the suffix pass-through protocol of the ARK ID system (Kunze and Rodgers 2013).There are several benefits to adding new periods to the PeriodO dataset.Simply creating authorities and periods using a local in-browser data source provides a structured Linked Data representation of that information that can be reused in a larger Linked Data dataset.

    "Submitting a patch with new authorities and periods to the main dataset furnishes those authorities and periods with persistent URIs, which further enhances the expression of a dataset as Linked Data.And contributing to the PeriodO gazetteer increases the general scholarly understanding of the ways different fields and traditions deploy periodization to organize information.In the future, it may also make a user's dataset easier to aggregate with others and more discoverable in chronological searches.Conclusion: Why Take the Time?All of the steps described in this recipe for the expression of temporal information as Linked Data are difficult and time-consuming.

    "Even the conversion of non-Gregorian dates to the ISO8601 standard is burdensome, especially when the question of a year zero comes up.Meanwhile, the aggregated time-based search and visualization tools that would demonstrate the usefulness of Linked Data representations of time are still in the prototype stage, and integration work like that done by the Pelagios project with data from ancient-world spatial gazetteers has not yet been carried out.

    "While there are some examples of visualizations that take advantage of periodized data,43 and while there are a number of current initiatives focused on developing the standards and platforms that will facilitate future aggregation and visualization of chronological information,44 there is still no temporal equivalent to the Peripleo spatial search engine.So why go to the trouble of adapting the dates and periods in your spreadsheet or relational database table to Linked Data datamodels, or contributing your period definitions to a gazetteer like PeriodO?The representation of temporal information as structured data offers both short- and long-term dividends, and these dividends are multiplied in a dataset represented as Linked Data.

    "In the short term, clear indications of calendrical system, the standardization of dates and date formats, and the explanation of period terms with reference to internal or external vocabularies simply make it easier for others to understand and reuse a given dataset.As data publication becomes more prevalent, it is worth thinking about that hypothetical spreadsheet of papyri not just in terms of the research carried out by its creator, but in terms of its benefit to a larger community. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "The more the creator can be transparent about the meanings of the datatypes a dataset contains, the more useful it will be to a broader audience.This is especially true when the creator of a dataset wishes to develop alternative or non-canonical vocabularies.Because of its focus on semantic information, the Linked Data ecosystem is inherently multivocal: if I have a simple way to explain exactly what I mean by a period term, I can be understood without having to use a conventional term from a defined vocabulary that may not fit my use case well.In the medium term, the semantic representation of period terms and the association of those terms with URIs in other datasets will make it easier to search across heterogeneous datasets by time. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "We can now use tools like the Peripleo browser to find information associated with a given ancient place across a variety of databases, even if they do not all call that place by the same name.If a similar Linked Data approach is adopted for periodized data, we will soon be able to search across datasets for items related to the Late Antique period, even when definitions of that period vary from database to database u2013 or, conversely, we will be able to search for items dated to the range 400-500 CE and find records like the papyrus in our hypothetical spreadsheet marked only as Late Antique. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Thus, not only will this approach to periodization make an individual dataset more transparent, but it will also make the records in that dataset more discoverable and easier to align and aggregate with other datasets.As an added benefit, it will also facilitate the digital visualization of the temporal distribution of items in a dataset: a URI that associates a period label like Late Antique with dates will allow records with that label to appear on a digital timeline.In the long term, the structured representation of periods in datasets related to the past will help us to understand our own scholarly disciplines. Source: Time for Linked Open Data",
    "Transparent references to the meaning of period terms will highlight the way that usage changes over time, as periodizations are revised or new periodizations are proposed.They will also highlight differences of opinion across scholarship and culture.These genealogical and discursive trends are a particular focus of PeriodO, which tracks derivative relationships across definitions in different authorities, and which is developing visualization tools to compare the spatiotemporal extents assigned to the same term by different scholars at different times.

    "Even more interesting is the possibility that structured temporal information expressed as Linked Open Data will provide training data for natural-language-processing approaches to text corpora.In this scenario, the transparent period definitions and date expressions in Linked Data datasets will be used to help machine-learning algorithms recognize and parse unstructured, opaque temporal references in texts.

    "We may make linguistic and onomastic observations about the name, among which its etymology, dating, gender assignment, relation to names in the same or other languages, religious or ethnic associations, sometimes even hints as to class or profession.With a greater degree of interpretive subjectivity, we may also associate the name with a particular individual from history, either known from other sources or only attested in this single text, but about whom one can adduce geographical, linguistic, dating, and other information, including perhaps relationships with other persons referenced in the same or other sources.There are also persons referenced in literary sources who are generally thought to be fictional, that is, not having a referent in the real historical world; or names that refer to religious or mythological entities that may or may not be thought to exist or have existed, but about whom dating and geographical statements are less commonly made.

(See in the meantime: Lawrence 2007; Lawrence, Jewell and Rissen 2010; Bodard et al, 2017.)Although this chapter focuses on ancient u2013 and primarily ancient Mediterranean u2013 historical persons, we should note that there are very few issues relating to the encoding or linking of classical person records that would not be equally applicable to discussions of prosopography relating to almost any other period of history or part of the world.

    "The scarcity of data about ancient (and most historical) populations, which drives the historian's interest in every scrap of information, fragmentary text, allusion, speculation and emendation, proves a qualitative difference from historical periods where census data and similar very rich sources survive at a much higher rate. A prosopographer is interested in the smallest piece of evidence for a person from, say, the fifth century BCE (even without an attested name), in the way that a similar datum would be trivial or irrelevant to most scholars of, for example, twentieth century CE history.

    "Most large datasets of ancient names or persons that I shall discuss in this chapter are not prosopographies in the technical sense u2013 studies of historical populations and societies that collate and interpret genealogical, onomastic and demographic information on individuals and groups, with particular reference to primary sources and scholarly discussion (cf.Keats-Rohan 2007).All of these types of dataset are nonetheless extremely rich as records of people and their associated names and data, and offer different facets of information to express in LOD.

    "Prosopographical datasets more properly include the Prosopographia Imperii Romani (PIR), Prosopography of the Byzantine World (PBW), and Hellenistic Babylonia: Texts, Images, Names (HBTIN), which tend to focus on specific and delimited time and place, language(s), and perhaps social class or categories of person.Equally valuable, and often orders of magnitude larger, are projects such as the Lexicon of Greek Personal Names (LGPN) or Trismegistos People (TM), which while they do not gather the richness of biographical and other information typical of a prosopography, do identify individuals and core information about them, including relationships with others, while often focusing principally on primary source citations and gathering onomastic data.A third category that is also a source of very large numbers of names and person references is the institutional or collection catalogue: the Perseus Catalog, the British Museum person database, the Virtual International Authority File (VIAF), the Zenon Catalogue of the Deutsche Archu00e4ologische Institut library, or other authority lists of persons such as potters (Kerameikos.org) or coin issuers (Nomisma.org).

    "Datasets such as these are a very valuable source of disambiguation records, since librarians have historically put a lot of effort into creating authority records and adhering to interoperable standards as far as possible, but they usually contain very little or no contextual information such as dating, geography, onomastics and interpersonal relationships.While the geographical and chronological specificity of prosopographies and personal name databases means that the overlap in population between any two databases is likely to be very small, the presence of a Western canon means that the overlap in ancient persons between any two library catalogues is generally very large, even almost complete.One of the most interesting elements of collecting large bodies of person data is the relationships of various kinds that the entities therein bring with them.

    "The body of information about any given person or collection of people is often expressed, or held in the scholar's mind, as a fluid, more or less chronological narrative, or as a collection of events and statements given to us by sources and placed in a historical context.Adding structure, or applying a model, to this information inevitably means distorting it: forcing some kinds of information into controlled vocabularies or restrictive typologies, leaving out details or elements that don't fit the model, making assumptions where required fields are missing from history. Source: Linked Open Data for Ancient Names and People",
    "A model, although (and indeed because) structured, is always misleading, distorting, imperfect.We have to mitigate this degrading of information by: assiduously documenting the model and the decisions made to fit our data into it; by supplementing the structured data with free-text descriptions for the human reader of features not expressed in LOD; by ensuring that the use we or a computer will make of the economies of scale or pattern detection made possible by implementing the model are worth the signal-loss; and by being explicit about the historical (and secondary) sources that feed into our data, so that a reader can go back to the start and check the raw data that we are thus perverting.2 In other words, if we extract information from a variety of sources to populate a uniform database record with names, dates, titles, relationships, and other data about a person, all of the sources, definitions, decisions and mechanisms for populating the individual fields should be preserved.Having said this, the nature of person-data as involving relationships between entities, places, persons, and other sorts of data and vocabularies, means that once structured or modelled as described absource: Linked Open Data for Ancient Names and People",
    "ove, this data can be very conveniently and effectively expressed in LOD, using the conceptual language RDF.As its name suggests, Linked Open Data is all about modelling data in terms of relationships between entities (people, places, events, things), properties (things we can say about entities, qualifiers, relationship types), or classes (vocabularies of predicates or descriptors, such as occupations, types of settlement, etc.). RDF is formed of statements that have three parts: entity A u2192 has relation or property B u2192 with entity or predicate C (where A, B and C are explicitly referenced by identifiers).

    "Two examples of this triple format might look like:tAristophanes (LGPN:V2-9254)tttis from (SNAP:associatedPlace)tttttAthens (Pleiades:579885).Lepcis Magna (Pleiades:344448)ttthas type (PleiadOnt:hasFeatureType)tttttsettlement (PleiadType:settlement).You will notice that all the entities (as well as properties and classes) are defined by identifiers; they would in practice be URLs, but I have abbreviated them for this example.3 This means that for RDF to make a statement about people, places, or anything else, the entities first have to be defined, and a list of the identifiers for them should ideally exist online (the LGPN, SNAP and Pleiades websites in the example above).

    "If there are also informative pages about the entity in question at the URL u2013 i.e. if the identifiers are dereferenceable u2013 this potentially enables the discovery of new resources via information on the web pages about these entities.Likewise, the properties and classes should be defined in vocabularies, thesauri or ontologies, which also assign to each one a unique identifier and a web address.This is where the linked in Linked Open Data gets its power: each RDF statement or triple makes a connection between entities and datasets, a link that can be followed back to sources, definitions, indexes, and collections of entities.

    "These highly structured records, abbreviated and designed for reading by an (initiated) human, can of course be readily generated from structured data, but the reverse is not the case u2013 in other words, they are not easily machine actionable data.Factoid ModelDigital publications of prosopographies make use of databases for structuring, sorting and presenting data in an explicitly structured way, and of advanced search and faceted browsing for organization and filtering of records. Source: Linked Open Data for Ancient Names and People",
    "Among the more popular recent approaches to this digital representation of prosopographical data, and most suitable for expressing as Linked Open Data, is the so-called Factoid Model (see Bradley & Short 2005 and Bradley 2016).In this model, the core entity in the database, as in the study of historical persons discussed above, is the attestation or source u2013 that is, the text in which an event, relationship, or trait of one or more people are mentioned. Source: Linked Open Data for Ancient Names and People",
    "The attested event other piece of information (factoid rather than fact because counter-factual or internally inconsistent attestations are valid entities in a prosopographical dataset) is both the glue that links together persons, primary and secondary texts, places, dates, and the other tables of the database, and one of the building blocks from which all person records are built.For example, a factoid relating to a database of person information relating to ancient Lepcis Magna might be the funerary inscription of Publius Lucretius Crescens, which was set up by his father at some point in the Imperial period.4 This source would then be linked from several places in the database: as source for the existence, name and (very rough) date of Crescens himself; as one of several sources for the existence, name etc. of Lucretius Rogatinus, the erector of the monument; and as source for the relationship between the two.One factoid may therefore be a component of several person records, and almost every person record will be made up of several such attestations. Source: Linked Open Data for Ancient Names and People",
    "Their name, their family relationships, professions or titles, marriage, participation in battles, treaties, coronations, and other historical events, are only part of our person record because they are attested in one or more sources.This model is therefore not only intellectually rigorous, making sure that all claims about a person are backed up in primary sources or secondary scholarship, but admirably transparent in communicating these sources, and other bases for statements, to the reader. Source: Linked Open Data for Ancient Names and People",
    "It is possible to browse the factoid database (see e.g. PBW) by any of the top-level entities, including u2013 in addition to people u2013 places, events, occupations, names, and indeed sources and factoids themselves.Text EncodingA much simpler scheme for encoding information about historical persons u2013 although one in which it is possible to model many of the same entities and relationships as I have been discussing above u2013 would be in encoded text, for example in TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) XML. XML is a strictly hierarchical language, so a single <person> element must completely encompass those elements containing core information about that person: name, dates, occupations, locations, etc. Source: Linked Open Data for Ancient Names and People",
    "However, the TEI content model also defines several attributes for linking to other elements or even external files, allowing the stand-off annotation of sections of text, or entities in a separate hierarchy from the person-list. A <person> element might be referenced from several <relation> elements, for example, which define family relationships with several other persons.Several <person> elements might all point to the same <event> element defining an event in which they all participated in some way.A simple person record (with external <relation> given for comparison) in TEI XML might look something like:t<person xml:id=person7>t   <persName xml:lang=grc>u0395u1f50u03b8u03aeu03c1u03b9u03bfu03c2<persName>t   <floruit notBefore=0392 notAfter=0393>t   <occupation>u03bau03ccu03bcu03b7u03c2<occupation>t   <affiliation ref=pleiades.stoa.orgplaces226564>Cherson<affiliation>t<person>t<relation active=#person7 ref=snap:BrotherOf passive=#person8>While this is a much flatter and more linear way of encoding person-data, it would probably be possible (if perhaps not the most efficient) to encode a basic factoid prosopography in this format.CataloguesAlthough they typically contain less information about each person, another very useful source of lists of persons is the library catalogue, or similar authority list of persons involved in a bibliographical, archival, or museum item database. Source: Linked Open Data for Ancient Names and People",
    "The catalogue may say very little more than each person's name and a bare minimum of biographical data (life or work dates, language, genre, nationality), the purpose of the list is to be completely unambiguous and very clear about the identity of individual persons, so that a book (or item, or record, etc.) can be ascribed to the correct person no matter how many homonyms may exist.However the data itself is encoded, library catalogues also follow very strict metadata schemas and vocabularies, and often expose their identifiers for the purpose of cross-referencing with other libraries. Source: Linked Open Data for Ancient Names and People",
    "It is useful to know that the Library of Congress's record for Alexander of Aphrodisias has the same referent as records in the British Library, the Hellenic and Roman Library, or Zenon catalogues.The very useful task of collating the many library catalogue authority lists in use is performed by the Online Computer Library Center's Virtual Internet Authority File (VIAF), which includes approximately 1,000 author records from the ancient world. VIAF and other authorities serve as the glue in the prosopographical data-space, rather than primarily as providers of new person and historical data.OnomasticsOther databases contain authority information about names themselves, in addition to or instead of identification of individual persons.

    "This onomastic data u2013 listing of unique names along with philological and historical information such as etymology, geographic or religious significance, morphology and variant spellings or language and script versions u2013 does not disambiguate between several persons all called Diomedes, but provides a record to which one can point to clarify that a name form Diomedes, Diomu00e8de, u0394u03b9u03bfu03bcu03aeu03b4u03b7u03c2, u062fu06ccu0648u0645u062fu0633 or u0414u0438u043eu043cu0435u0434 (each with one or more language codes attached) is a variant form of a particular ancient name.Person data resources such as Trismegistos, the Lexicon of Greek Personal Names, and Celtic Personal Names of Roman Britain all list unique names as separate entities from the person data. Source: Linked Open Data for Ancient Names and People",
    "As with persons, name records may be expressed as fields in a database record, elements in TEI XML, or RDF statements, and the more formalized the data and entities that are attached to each name, the easier it will be to connect these names to the web of open data, other projects, person and name records.Such onomastic data enriches and enables discovery in and interoperability between individual person-databases in a combined ecosystem.Disambiguating Person ReferencesIn many of the kinds of database discussed above, the process of compiling an unambiguous person authority often begins by disambiguating the many possible duplicate person references identified in a text or corpus. Source: Linked Open Data for Ancient Names and People",
    "Each string of text that contains a personal name or other appellation refers directly or indirectly to a person.Identifying a person-reference is relatively unambiguous, but disambiguating the person or entity to whom it refers is an intellectual activity, and may involve uncertainty, the citation of evidence or argument, and be facilitated by the existence of a list of already known persons.For example, the Trismegistos database of text and person data from ancient Egypt, collects data in several related but separate databases.Texts (c. 680,000 records), the texts, mostly papyri, from ancient Egypt and the Nile valley; References (c. 500,000 records), listing each attestation of a person; will be duplicates even if, for example, the same person is clearly named twice in the same line of the same text; People (c. 370,000 records), listing individual persons once only, however many times they are attested; Names (c. 33,000 records), giving unique names, many of which are of course used by several different persons (there are also larger tables of name variants and declined name forms).This workflow results in an important collection of data that is both a reflection of the activity of moving from source texts to disambiguated name and person data, and a working tool that can be used in the process of further refining and adding new texts and person records to the database. Source: Linked Open Data for Ancient Names and People",
    "Each of these database tables are exposed on the project website, and each record in them has a stable identifier that means all texts, attestations, persons and names can be used as an authority for disambiguating or relating from other internal or external data.Person records can be related to each other (or to those in LGPN, PIR or other databases), name variants can be used to expand the value of poorer records, and so forth.

    "Even if the 3D research is not specifically archaeological, some of the workflows and methodologies can be used or re-tooled in order to effectively manage and organize these data so they can be used beyond their initial creation.The assumption for ADS is that one is generating data in a number of different mediums typical in archaeology; databases, images, Computer Aided Design or CAD graphics, Geographical Information System (GIS) files, spreadsheets, and word-processed files. Source: Linked Open Data for 3D Models and Environments",
    "These file types are also rather typical in 3D research projects as CAD and GIS also have the capability to interface nicely with 3D technologies and have some built in 3D functionalities.Database structures are not only helpful in cataloging the data used or consulted to create 3D research, but also may be a product of the 3D modeling processes, and images, as you might imagine, also play a large role in provided reference and textures to 3D models and have been one of the ways to create a record of 3D research.3D models are typically not only comprised of 3D data, the x, y, z's that create the visualization.

    "They are usually a combination of the aforementioned datatypes and resources.Linked Open Data would provide a mode to link these datatypes into a digital representation of the relations it takes to generate the research so that one can trace the research processes.As already mentioned, this has been a relatively informal process by linking the data to additional resources by proximity (i.e. journal article with downloadable 3D dataset) or in a README text file packaged with the 3D data.

    "With this, we can begin to set up 3D data in a way that can be more easily integrated into LOD practice.This is where the ADS Guides to Good Practice really helps with some concrete suggestions on best practices for integrated datasets that provide and require additional (albeit archaeological) context.Of use and relevance are the sections dedicated to The Project Lifecycle and Data Analysis and Visualisation. Source: Linked Open Data for 3D Models and Environments",
    "These sections provide an overview of various relevant topics including how to plan for the data your digital project will create, how to properly curate your data by selecting appropriate file formats, where and how to archive your data, and some specifics on how to collect and maintain 3D archaeological data (more specifics regarding 3D data will be addressed later in this paper).3DICONSEstablished in 2012 as a joint effort funded by the European Commission, the three-year project culminated in 3DICONS, among others, to support the development of Europeana, the European digital library. 3DICONS is divided into two parts: guidelines and case studies of 3D scanning and remote sensing of cultural heritage sites and artifacts.

    "Insofar as ancient 3D research is concerned, it is entirely possible that there will be some kind of 3D scanning or remote sensing involved in the final research product.7 As was discussed in the consideration of ADS guidelines, 3DICONS is extremely helpful in setting up a 3D research project by clearly defining appropriate approaches to 3D data capture that will facilitate the use of any metadata for Linked Open Data applications.Researchers collaborating with scholars across Europe may find this resource particularly helpful when generating 3D research data that must interface with already established metadata records or repositories. Source: Linked Open Data for 3D Models and Environments",
    "Keep in mind that 3DICONS is intended for European monumental and archaeological sites, so 3D research on, say, the scanned remains of a Fayum mummy may not be easily captured if following these guidelines.Still, some considerations of 3D scanning methodologies and strategies, as well as documenting the process are useful elements from the 3DICONS guidelines to consider for any type of scanning project.At this stage, there is no one size fits all guideline for 3D data curation nor for distribution or linking.

Source: Linked Open Data for 3D Models and Environments",
    "These principles and pursuits have implications for the application of Linked Open Data as well.As the following efforts progress, there will be opportunity for the creation of a standardized, broadly applicable system that will integrate 3D research with Linked Open Data.The endeavors below build upon the availability of the technology and the willingness to create standardization that will ultimately facilitate LOD and the proliferation of connected 3D scholarship that builds upon previous work, reduces duplicated efforts whether unknowingly or due to data loss or lack of access.

    "The groundwork is there, we only need guidance.Moving Forward: Towards Linked Open 3D DataIn 2016, PARTHENOS, a European consortium, produced a whitepaper outlining the major hurdles to 3D scholarship adaptation and dissemination.Concerns previously noted, such as quality assessment, repeatability, feedback and critique, nonlinearity, multimodality, scalability, registration, reliability, interoperability, and preservation are all surfaced again in the PARTHENOS whitepaper. Source: Linked Open Data for 3D Models and Environments",
    "The discussion of linking 3D data is relevant to our needs here (Alliez, p. 24) as it outlines where we currently are in terms of LOD and 3D research.Much of the discussion centers around annotation potentials using various technologies and visualization packages like 3DHOP in order to build a more robust 3D reconstruction or representation by inserting relevant annotations to cite and expound upon sections of a 3D model in 3D space. 3D annotation allows researchers to clearly mark aspects of a 3D model for further expounding or as foci for users. Source: Linked Open Data for 3D Models and Environments",
    "The annotations have the potential to include links to other resources whether 2D or 3D and embed additional contextual prose.These are meant to provide a more academically robust 3D model by effectively providing in-situ citation.Such links, through spatial correspondences, yields an information continuum between different media (3D, 2D)... where annotations could be performed just on one mediaitem and then propagated to many other mediaitems (Alliez, p. 27).Potential 3D annotation technologies that exist as a stop gap for LOD and 3D are (not exhaustive and currently an area of development):3DHOP 3D Semantic Annotation (3DSA) Agata Arrigo CityEngine, ESRICultlab3D ShapeAnnotator Sketchfab's 3D web viewer VSim These technologies all have their own restrictions of use and limitations such as not being able to interface with other media types (like images) though such annotation may be essential to the point of the annotation or the relative clunkiness of the navigation and positioning of annotations in 3D space, but this is indeed progress.

    "Though we still lack the technical, institutional and cultural frameworks required to support such open data access of 3D research, we should strive to avoid the inevitable shortfall in the sharing of data by researchers because we do not anticipate these data's use and reuse beyond the immediate creation (Data's Shameful Neglect, p. 145).Though the context of this quote is focused on scientific data creation, it is motivation for us to think more seriously about the potentials of LOD and 3D research.In order to begin supporting LOD creation in our work with 3D, there are several required data categories and datatypes outlined as part of the PARTHENOS 2016 whitepaper.Different types of metadata relevant to the discussion of 3D research:Project level metadata u2013 the data about the project overall including the subject matter, the creators, dates etc. that would provide an overview of the 3D research product.

    "This mode of recording is useful, but not ideal.Instead, set up record keeping and metadata creation within a spreadsheet or database.This may feel foreign at first, but spreadsheets are the mode of metadata transfer for librarians and archivists and are industry practice.As the standards for 3D metadata emerge and are adopted, it will be much more efficient and therefore much more likely that your 3D research will be catalogued and preserved because of your efforts to generate your metadata records in a spreadsheet rather than a word processing document u2013 or indeed in any other proprietary software.8At the time of writing, the metadata recommendations provided by ADS are the most succinct examples to follow.

Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "Coins, for example, have two sides, both of which must be described.They are both pictorial and textual.Physical characteristics such as material, weight, diameter, and the relationship of the heads to tails (obverse to reverse) directions (axis) can be recorded.Coins have denominational systems that vary with time and place, and those times and places may require systems of chronology and geography that vary from standard, modern formats (e.g., 1543-1532 BC, first quarter of the second century, Byzantium, Constantinople.) There is also a vast array of information about individuals involved in the production of coinage whose names and titles may vary over time, and find no easy analogue in any other discipline: Augustus, Octavian, Tresvir, moneyer, die-engraver. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "In a further twist, it is often necessary to record not just the details of an individual coin, but also its relationship to others: the context of its circumstances of discovery, a taxonomic arrangement, a commercial transaction, or its current physical disposition.Solutions: Creating a Linked DisciplineCoinage is thus a rich source for the study of the ancient world, and the study of Roman Imperial coinage in particular is well established in the print medium. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "Roman numismatists have, over the past century, divided their discipline into four discrete areas of study.The basic structure of Imperial coinage has been the focus of a type corpus known as Roman Imperial Coinage (RIC), printed in 10 volumes, providing a basic description of each of the 40,000+ recorded varieties of the coinage.It is the standard reference work for all who catalogue and publish Roman coins in any context. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "These contexts may be divided into three separate types, which have formed the subject of the other three areas of focus of numismatic study: collections, hoards, and individual finds.Roman coins exist in the hundreds of thousands in the major public collections across the world.Hoards (coins buried together in antiquity) are found today in astonishing numbers across the former territory of the Empire. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "Single finds are similarly common, both within archaeologically excavated contexts, where their scientific value is enhanced, or as chance or metal-detector finds.As Fig. 4 describes, all four of these areas of study are fundamentally interlinked since collections may contain hoards and single finds, and any coin from any context must be described by RIC type for it to be properly published and usable in historical synthesis.Fig. 4. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "The linked nature of Numismatic Study.In a very obvious sense, Roman numismatics was a prime candidate for the introduction of a Linked Data approach to the entire range of publications required by the discipline.In 2011 the American Numismatic Society began, in collaboration with a number of strategic partners, the process of developing the necessary infrastructure for the creation of linked Roman numismatic data. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "These technological principles have been expanded to include a significant portion of Hellenistic numismatics at the date of this publication, and collaborators in England, France, and Spain are working on pre-Roman Gallic and Iberian coinage.5Vocabulary and OntologyA key element of this infrastructure are the stable URIs required to describe numismatic concepts.As noted above, there are elements of coin-description peculiar to numismatics that require a tailored approach to the creation of a discipline-specific vocabulary. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "Here we were able to harness a project (http:nomisma.org) established by Sebastian Heath and Andrew Meadows in 2010 to provide stable digital representations of numismatic concepts in the form of http URIs that also provide access to reusable information about those concepts, along with links to other resources.This allows us to build a graph of Roman coin data that is linked within Roman numismatics by the use of discipline-specific terms such as denominations (e.g., http:nomisma.orgiddenarius) or mints (http:nomisma.orgidlugdunum), but also allows us to join the broader graph of ancient world data through the use of common identifiers such as Pleiades URIs (e.g., https:pleiades.stoa.orgplaces167717) for ancient places and the Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) for other categories of concepts (e.g., denominations such as denarius: http:vocab.getty.eduaat300037266). Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "By this simple decision we were able to ensure, in theory at least, the integration of numismatic data within the field of Roman numismatics, but also the permeation of numismatic material into other fields of study.The launch In July 2013 of a revised Nomisma.org system, based on Apache Fuseki,6 with a SPARQL endpoint and improved APIs, has allowed us to integrate Nomisma IDs fully into a number of numismatic projects.By forming a concordance between Nomisma.org-defined concepts and URIs in external information systems, it is possible to integrate numismatic data into the broader ancient world Linked Open Data cloud. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "For example, a coin minted in Lugdunum, as defined in Nomisma, is by extension produced in its Pleiades equivalent.The underlying machine-readable data in Nomisma facilitate the direct publication of the American Numismatic Society's Greco-Roman materials to Pelagios (via the Peripleo web application) through the ANS digital collection, MANTIS (http:numismatics.orgsearch).Similarly, a Nomisma API, built on an underlying SPARQL query, enables content from Nomisma's partners (both small and large institutions) to make their materials available in Pelagios. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "This is an especially valuable feature for partners who simply lack the technical personnel or expertise to build these data exports directly into their own database systems.Of the nearly 200,000 Greek and Roman coins available in the Nomisma.org SPARQL endpoint, more than 134,000 are available to Pelagios through this API.Today, more than 5,000 intellectual concepts have been defined by Nomisma.org across a growing number of periods, cultures and categories. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "While Greco-Roman concepts were the first focus of the project, it has grown to include partial coverage of Islamic numismatics and Medieval and early Modern European concepts.Categories of terms range from materials and denominations to geographic identifiers, like mints and regions, to personal, corporate, or dynastic entities responsible for the minting of coinage.Nomisma is overseen by a steering committee, and the responsibility for creating and maintaining IDs has fallen to discipline-specific working groups, such as for Roman, Greek, and Medieval numismatics.Nomisma underwent another significant architectural overhaul in 2014, including a migration of data into a more standards-compliant model following modern Semantic Web specifications. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "This process included the introduction of the Nomisma ontology, developed by Karsten Tolle, a computer scientist at the University of Frankfurt, in collaboration with numismatists and developers on the Nomisma steering committee.7 The Nomisma ontology is not designed around closed-world principles in linked data.Numismatic data should not be exclusively confined to the properties and classes defined within the ontology. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "Rather, concepts in Nomisma are modeled primarily in the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS), an ontology designed for the expression of taxonomies and internal and external linkages between terms.The Nomisma ontology as it applies to concepts further refines our application of SKOS by defining specific classes of information.The mint of Rome is designated by the URI http:nomisma.orgontology#Mint (shorted to nmo:Mint). A denarius is an nmo:Denomination. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "The thesaurus uses properties and classes from numerous ontologies, from Dublin Core Terms for titles and bibliographic references to the WGS84 geographic ontology for geospatial coordinates.8 Rather than inventing a new property or class for every possible type of information, the ontology is intended to fill gaps in existing ontologies and facilitate the organization of numismatic information in a way that reflects how numismatists themselves classify and query objects. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "Therefore, properties in the ontology correspond to classes: a coin or coin type from Rome carries the property nmo:hasMint linking to http:nomisma.orgidrome, and nmo:hasDenomination linking to http:nomisma.orgiddenarius.A Type CorpusThe existence of a full print corpus of Roman Imperial Coinage (RIC) provided a ready-made framework for the creation of an online type corpus. A project was established in 2011 jointly by the ANS and New York University's Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (ISAW) to build an online adaptation of this resource on the principles of Linked Data. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "This project benefited from head-starts in two areas.First the resource for the creation of necessary URIs existed in the Nomisma.org project; second, the collection database of the ANS (http:numismatics.orgsearch) already contained the descriptive elements of approximately one-third of the c. 40,000 known types of Imperial coinage.From these two resources we were quickly able, with technical implementation by Gruber and data under the management of Dr. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "Gilles Bransbourg, to establish Online Coins of the Roman Empire (OCRE, http:numismatics.orgocre), a type corpus of Roman coinage.Initially launched in July 2012 and with the types from Augustus to Hadrian, the project was completed in 2017 (although errors continue to be fixed), following a three-year grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH).9As work progressed on the creation of type records within OCRE, we created the Nomisma.org URIs necessary for their description. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "The Linked Data approach we have taken to the creation of OCRE has a number of obvious payoffs.An attractive feature is that by providing alternative names for all Nomisma.org concepts in multiple languages, we have been able quickly and easily build a multilingual interface (compare Figs. 5a and 5b), derived from SKOS-defined preferred labels in RDF extracted real-time from Nomisma.org's APIs.To date 17 languages are supported, including English, German, and French (among the more common languages among our user-base), but also Bulgarian, Polish, and Arabic, which do see significant usage. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "The advantages to the Linked Data approach run deeper, too.Where the Roman Imperial Coinage type corpus can do nothing but describe the types themselves and illustrate a single representative example of a selected few types, OCRE has the power to link to multiple examples of a given type from multiple contexts.There are now 31 partners and 117,570 total specimens from an international range of museum and archaeological databases aggregated by Nomisma.org and made accessible through OCRE.Fig. 5a.

Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "In early 2015, the ANS, in collaboration with colleagues at the British Museum, released Coinage of the Roman Republic Online (CRRO, http:numismatics.orgcrro).Later that year, PELLA (http:numismatics.orgpella), a type corpus of the coinage of Alexander the Great, was released.In late 2017, the first iteration of Seleucid Coins Online (SCO, http:numismatics.orgsco) publicly launched, and the final version of this and the first phase of Ptolemaic Coins Online (http:numismatics.orgpco) were published in November-December 2018. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "These latter three projects fall under the umbrella of Hellenistic Royal Coinages, a project funded by the NEH in 2017, and will conclude by 2020.Type Corpus to HoardsIn parallel with the development of OCRE, the ANS collaborated with Dr.Kris Lockyear of the University College London's Institute of Archaeology to create (with implementation by Gruber) an online database of Roman Republican coin hoards (CHRR, http:numismatics.orgchrr).11 This is based on Dr. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "Lockyear's personal research database (originally in MS Access; see Lockyear 2007), which is a substantially enlarged version of a print volume (Crawford 1969).Published in 2013 and consisting mainly of hoards of exclusively Roman Republican materials, approximately 10% of the hoards also contained early Augustan coin types (Lockyear and Gruber 2013).Initially CHRR drew on machine-readable data provided by OCRE's APIs for Augustan types and Nomisma.org to extract Republican coin type data to facilitate geographic and statistical analyses, but now it extracts data from CRRO's APIs for Republican data (with the Nomisma IDs having been deprecated following the publication of CRRO). Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "Lockyear's cataloging burden is now significantly lowered since the responsibility for long-term maintenance of Roman Republican and Imperial coin type data falls into the domain of the editors of those online corpora.OCRE and CRROs' data APIs enable CHRR to extract machine-readable data in real-time in order to render HTML pages (see e.g., Fig. 6a), generate GeoJSON and KML for maps and timelines (the distribution of types within a hoard over time and space), and facilitate a wide variety of quantitative analyses. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "Similarly, the Linked Open Data for these hoards are ingested into the Nomisma.org SPARQL endpoint, enabling the mapping of the distribution of findspots for specific types directly within OCRE and CRRO (see e.g., Fig. 6b).Taking this one step further, these find-spot data apply to any distinct Nomisma-defined concept connected to published typologies.Map 1, above, displays the geographic distribution of denarii by means of physical specimens linked to denarius types defined in OCRE and CRRO and their individual findspots or by Roman Republican coin hoards with type URIs linked to nm:denarius.

Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "The practice of assigning unique URIs to individual objects, now recommended by the International Council of Museums, and adopted by the majority of major collections, allows for stable connections to be built between those objects and typological records that describe them.So, for example, a coin type record can link to multiple instances of that coin type held in multiple collections or archaeological datasets (although in actuality, the link is from the specimen to type within the underlying LOD). Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "Fig. 7, for example, shows the CRRO record for RRC 2861, with references to 102 specimens of the type from 12 different collections, from large national collections such as the ANS and British Museum to small ones such as Rutgers University and the Fralin Museum of Art at the University of Virginia, as well as numerous coins registered in the PAS.Fig 7. A selection of physical specimens identified as RRC 2861. (RRC 2861, Coinage of the Roman Republic Online, accessed October 26, 2020, http:numismatics.orgcrroidrrc-286.1.)Through the ingestion into the Nomisma SPARQL endpoint of the specific characteristics, such as the weight or die axis of each specimen, it is possible to create tools to analyze the characteristics of individual types or of coins issued in particular places or by specified emperors (see Fig. 8a). Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "Analysis can also be carried out on the generic characteristics of types using a similar set of set of filters.See, for example, Fig. 8b, which compares the frequency of the depiction of deities on the coinages of Augustus and Nero. OCRE, CRRO, and other individual type corpora enable these statistical visualizations among types within their own series, but we are beginning to build user interfaces in Nomisma.org itself to enable analyses more broadly across all periods and cultures of coinage. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "For example, it is possible to visualize the change in average weight of denarii between the late Roman Republic and early Empire, a question that cannot be asked of data and user interfaces within OCRE or CRRO exclusively.Fig. 8a.The change in weight of denarius (blue) vs. antontinianus (red) from 30 to 300 derived from OCRE-linked coins.The gradual decline in weight (silver content) is apparent during the Crisis of the Third Century.Fig. 8b.

    "In this case it is not just the physical characteristics of the specimens concerned, but also their findspots which serve as the basis of enhanced analysis through mapping.Fortunately the price of admission to the Linked Data community for Roman numismatics is low.Existing projects, with, in some cases, well developed and longstanding databases of finds do not need to change their recording practices or software. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "So long as their data can be mapped to Nomisma and type corpus URIs when they are exposed to the Web, then the finds may enter the graph of numismatic data on the Web.The UK's Portable Antiquities Scheme has been using Nomisma URIs since at least 2011.The Antike Fundmu00fcnzen Europa and Finds of Roman Coins in Poland projects were integrated into the numismatic linked data cloud in 2015 and 2017, respectively.Moreover, the exchange of data is potentially a two-way street.

    "These ANS-published type descriptions are fully and freely downloadable, and may serve to populate other databases, without the need for their creators to redo the work of cataloging that has already gone into the creation of the type record.Just as now few librarians catalogue books from scratch, so in the future there will be little need for the cataloguer of coins to generate new descriptions of coins long known.Linked Open Data Architecture, AppliedHow does Linked Data help in technical terms?source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "The most efficient method for maintaining the relationships between coin types and their associated coins and hoards is with the use of an RDF database and SPARQL endpoint.Type corpora published in the Numishare platform (e.g., OCRE) directly query the endpoint to deliver some types of services.In other cases OCRE interacts with REST APIs offered by Nomisma (simple web service interfaces which conduct more complicated SPARQL queries in the background). Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "The second, SPARQL-aware version of OCRE was released in October 2013.12 The RDF requires three components of data: first, RDF representations of coin types, second RDF descriptions of physical coins or coin hoards, and finally, the RDF data of concepts defined by Nomisma.org, which enables links to be made from typological attributes (e.g., http:nomisma.orgidar for silver coins or http:nomisma.orgidaugustus for those of Augustus) between types and coinshoards. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "The RDF model conforms to the numismatic ontology and Metadata Application Profile established by Nomisma.It is relatively simple, especially compared with CIDOC-CRM, and lowers the barrier for participation in these type corpus projects.To date, more than 30 organizations are contributing coin specimens, types, finds, andor hoard data to the Nomisma.org numismatic research ecosystem.We can see the relationship between ideal type descriptions and individual specimens more clearly by looking at an example. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "Additional hoard or findspot information may be added, as well as International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) service metadata (to be described in the section below).This simple model for translating numismatic metadata into Linked Open Data utilizes several Nomisma-defined ontology properties, but also implements Friend of a Friend (FOAF), Dublin Core Terms, and Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets (VoID).14Note that the RDF description of this object in the Berlin collection does not explicitly denote its material (silver), denomination (denarius), or other typological attributes. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "Like a relational database, the Nomisma LOD graph enables queries by these attributes by the association between the coin and the coin type by means of the nmo:hasTypeSeriesItem property.Practically speaking, how does this affect OCRE?Rather than updating records in OCRE when the collections of new partners become available, the RDF database stands apart, making it easier to update Apache Fuseki with new collections and manage changes or deletions in collections already contained in the system. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "Therefore, when Nomisma gains a new partner, these coin data and associated findspots, images, and measurements become available immediately upon ingestion into the endpoint.Using SPARQL, OCRE (through the Numishare application code) can query Fuseki to display images of coins associated with particular types in record or search results pages. SPARQL query results can be serialized into KML and GeoJSON directly and displayed in maps, making it possible to make use of findspots from online coin hoard catalogs. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "Using mathematical functions inherent to SPARQL, average weights of coin types or specific typologies (e.g., denarii of Augustus) can be delivered to OCRE directly and rendered in the form of charts and graphs (Fig. 8a) by the Javascript library, Highcharts, which is capable of interpreting this data into HTML5 graphics.15Participating in the Numismatic Linked Open Data EcosystemThe Nomisma project has maintained a documentation section on its website with basic details on how to model basic specimen data into RDF16 While we have yet to write a formal Metadata Application Profile that details each class and property in the Nomisma data model and their specific semantic meanings, the basic principles for contributing to the numismatic LOD cloud are fairly straightforward:According to the basic principles of the Semantic Web and recommendations for museum objects from ICOM, each coin must be available at a distinct URI. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "Ideally, the URI should follow the Clean URL pattern: there should be no portions of the URL that are distinct to particular software platforms (like a '.php' or other programming-specific file extensions) or request parameters (variables passed in the URL following the '?' character).17 An example of a Clean URI is a coin in the ANS collection: http:numismatics.orgcollection1944.100.51606.The accession number forms part of the URI, and the collection namespace is stable regardless of software platform (there have been three frameworks used for the online collection since 2010).At present, we are only ingesting physical specimens related to published type corpora, and we only have the capacity to ingest specimens whose type attribution is clear and completely certain. Source: Numismatics and Linked Open Data",
    "Therefore, each coin contributed to Nomisma.org should have one nmo:hasTypeSeriesItem linking to a coin type URI in OCRE, PELLA, etc.There are some exceptions to this rule, as there is overlap between Hellenistic type catalogs.Early Seleucid coins struck in the name of Alexander the Great may appear in both PELLA and Seleucid Coinage Online, so it is possible to have more than one URI, but in different corpora.Every coin must have a human-readable title (although it can be automatically generated), but images, measurements, and findspots are optional.The Nomisma Data ModelThe How to Contribute Data page (http:nomisma.orgdocumentationcontribute) on Nomisma.org will contain the most up-to-date documentation on the Nomisma data models for contributing numismatic objects (coins, medals, tokens, etc.).

    "Fig. 9 is an illustration of a typical model for a coin, although there are several additional properties that may optionally be applied. A full definition of the required and optional properties is as follows:Coin URI: encoded differently in various RDF serializations: XML, JSON-LD, Turtle, etc.Nomisma.Coin Hoards of the Roman Empire will be published into Nomisma eventually.

    "Many organizations publish their digital images at varying sizes or resolutions.It is most common for collections to publish thumbnail images as well as reference images that are intended to be viewed in the pages for individual object records (typically 400-600 pixels in a particular dimension).The following RDF metadata defines this dataset:<http:coins.lib.virginia.edu> rdf:type void:Dataset ;        dcterms:description The Fralin Museum of Art at the University of Virginia numismatic collection contains about 600 coins of mainly Greco-Roman origin.This paper, a revision and enhancement of a work published in 2014 by the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World in its ISAW Papers series, illustrates a current State of the Field of digital numismatics.

    "Yet, if one looks at different modern editions of Plato's text, precisely where a certain paragraph or page starts can differ from edition to edition, because Stephanus' original paragraphs often break the text mid-sentence and sometimes even mid-word.As a result, comparing the text of two different editions requires some adjustments and interpretation by a human reader.Taking another example, a reader has to be aware that Petronii Arbitri Affranii Satyrici lib., Petronii Arbitri Satyri fragmenta ex libro quinto decimo et sexto decimo, Petronii Arbitri Satiricon, Petronii Arbitri Satyricon, Petronii Arbitri Satirici fragmenta, and excerta petronii satiriei, point to the same work.[urn:cts:scholarship:lod.discussion:intro.2]Because the CITE architecture is highly precise, it is used in many historical text digitization efforts and research projects: most significantly, in the Homer Multitext Project (the project for which the CITE architecture was originally created), the Perseus Digital Library and Scaife Digital Library Viewer at Tufts University, and the Open Greek and Latin Project (OGL), which, between them, have created the largest openly-licensed, structured machine-actionable corpus of classical Latin and Greek literature.

    "Firstly, to go back to the beginning, Chris and Neel, when and why did you create the CITE architecture?[urn:cts:scholarship:lod.discussion:answer.1]Chris Blackwell & Neel Smith: Casey Duu00e9, Mary Ebbott, and Gregory Nagy conceived a project to produce a 21st-century edition of the Homeric Iliad, an edition based on their understanding of the nature of that text as a product of a thousand-year evolution of a tradition of composition-in-performance. Source: The CITE Architecture: Q & A Regarding CTS and CITE",
    "This edition would be a multitext rather than a critical edition; the goal would not be to analyze the surviving witnesses to the text and, when they differ on a line or passage, throw away all but a single, ostensibly authentic version.Rather, they see that in the transmission of the Iliad the various differing readings preserved in manuscripts and ancient commentaries reflect a fundamental aspect of the Iliad: that variation is an essential part of this poetry. Source: The CITE Architecture: Q & A Regarding CTS and CITE",
    "When we were brought on to this project, we knew we would need to be able to talk precisely and imprecisely about many versions of the same text.Precisely, as in Book 2, line 4 of the Iliad as preserved on the Venetus A manuscript; imprecisely, as in Book 10 of the Iliad, in all of its manifestations through its transmission history.We also knew that this would be a long task, which motivated us to try to separate concerns as much as possible, on the assumption that generations of technologies would likely pass into obsolescence before we had a scholarly product.

    "Canonical citation has worked as a linking mechanism for centuries, and CITE is just a machine-actionable update to that ancient technology.[urn:cts:scholarship:lod.discussion:question.2]TK: So it was invented by philologists for philologists and as a result it has already been implemented in several edition projects.Who, then, can use the CITE architecture?[urn:cts:scholarship:lod.discussion:answer.2a]CB & NS: Anyone with canonically citable texts or data. Source: The CITE Architecture: Q & A Regarding CTS and CITE",
    "So what does that mean?We can start with texts as an example.If you have a text, and you can assign identifiers to work-group, work, and version, and you can assign a unique identifier to each of its parts (which may or may not be in a hierarchy), and the contents of those parts is not going to change, then you have a canonically citable text.This seems simple to us, but we have been surprised at how many electronic texts are put online without attention to their long-term status as objects of study. Source: The CITE Architecture: Q & A Regarding CTS and CITE",
    "Scholars with unique texts, or texts with complicated histories, seem unwilling simply to assign an arbitrary identifier to a text-group (especially), or work, or version.There seems to be a perceived need for an identifier to be descriptive, and (with that mistake made), for the descriptive identifier to have the burden of saying everything about the text.This is an unhelpful attitude. A scholar with a newly edited papyrus, for example, can just define IDs in an independent namespace and proceed: urn:cts:papyrins:02034.34.1:1 is a perfectly good URN. CTS URNs, after all, are generally going to be handled by machines.Another stumbling block seems to be the necessity that a canonically citable text not change. Source: The CITE Architecture: Q & A Regarding CTS and CITE",
    "Digital scholars love doing dynamic things.While a text-under-constant-editing (or a data-collection) may be a valuable locus of scholarly activity, it is not yet a published scholarly work.Publish a text citable by CTS URN, and if you edit it later, publish a new version.This is one of the important benefits of CTS, which allows many versions to be aligned.[urn:cts:scholarship:lod.discussion:answer.2b]James Tauber: In terms of usage, I think it's worth considering not only the publishers of texts (and, as Chris points out, other citable data) but those consuming such texts or wanting to say something about those texts or passages within them. Source: The CITE Architecture: Q & A Regarding CTS and CITE",
    "You don't need to be publishing new works to benefit from CTS.On the consumption side, one application of CTS is in building reading environments like the Scaife Digital Library Viewer.Canonical references can be used for retrieval of texts from a repository to read, as bookmarks, for reading lists, and so on.Another is in text-processing tools that ingest machine-actionable texts.Being able to retrieve texts and text passages via a uniform identifier can help improve the reproducibility of text-processing tasks because you can record the CTS URNs of the exact passages of a particular version you retrieved and others can repeat the same. Source: The CITE Architecture: Q & A Regarding CTS and CITE",
    "Finally, CTS URNs become a powerful identifier for those wanting to say something about a text, such as annotators or commentary writers.One can conceive of CTS-based citations servers which can be queried for known annotations or commentaries on a particular passage.In this way the publishers of texts, the readers of those texts, and the commentators on those texts can work without even knowing the others exist but things interoperate through common use of CTS URNs.[urn:cts:scholarship:lod.discussion:question.3]TK: Thanks for mentioning the Scaife Digital Library Viewer (https:scaife.perseus.org), James, which is the latest environment in which people can read the CTS-compatible text of OGL, including the Perseus Digital Library, which used the CITE architecture from early on.

A design principle of Syriaca.org is to facilitate these existing lines of research while also creating a flexible data model that will not foreclose new directions of research.As already noted, the development of Syriac Studies has often been as an auxiliary part of larger fields of inquiry. Source: Using Linked Open Data to Model Cultural Heritage Information: The Research Questions and Data Structures of the Syriaca.org Knowledge Graph",
    "Four of the six areas identified by Brock fall in this category and share a common pattern of research questions.11 The first area is the field of Biblical Studies which has sustained a long research interest in Syriac versions of the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament with an aim to understanding the relationships of the multiple Syriac Bible translations to each other and to their Vorlagen in Greek, Aramaic, and Hebrew. Source: Using Linked Open Data to Model Cultural Heritage Information: The Research Questions and Data Structures of the Syriaca.org Knowledge Graph",
    "Questions of provenance have led scholars to research textual versions, manuscripts, scribes, translators, sponsors, and commentators across a wide geographical region.Where did the Syriac Bible versions originate?What sources did they use?What theological influences shaped their translations?Who funded Bible production?What manuscripts have survived, and where were they copied, preserved, or read?source: Using Linked Open Data to Model Cultural Heritage Information: The Research Questions and Data Structures of the Syriaca.org Knowledge Graph",
    "In the Syriaca.org knowledge graph these relationships are mapped conceptually as a network of texts, manuscripts, persons, places, and themes.These same concepts are also relevant to a second group, scholars of the history of Christianity who have shown increasing interest in Christian texts from Late Antiquity, both those written in Syriac and Greek texts preserved in Syriac translation.Their research questions are concerned with recovering Greek original texts from the Syriac translations and also with tracing the reception history of ancient and medieval theological themes in Syriac literature.While much of the surviving Syriac literature is Christian in origin, its historical import for the field of Religious Studies is broader given its geographic and cultural proximity to both Judaism and Islam.12 Scholars interested in the interaction of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are often interested in questions of the transmission and influence of ideas and texts across religious and linguistic traditions.

    "What Christian texts were known by early Islamic scholars?Did Syriac biblical commentators know of Rabbinic commentary?Which texts were available to particular readers?Perhaps most attention has been given to the transmission of ancient Greek philosophy and medicine to the Islamic world through the work of Syriac translators.As Brock notes, however, research on Syriac as a bridge culture is much more than the meeting of Byzantium and Islam: It was, however, not only into Arabic that translations from Syriac were made: by the end of the first millennium AD works in Syriac had found their way into languages as diverse as Greek, Armenian, Georgian, Middle Persian, Sogdian, Coptic, and Ethiopic.13 As in Biblical Studies and scholarship on early Christianity, scholars studying Syriac cultural encounters in the context of religious studies have focused on questions of manuscript provenance, authorship, textual identification, transmission of themes and ideas, and geographic dissemination.The fourth research area highlighted by Brock is the relevance of Syriac Studies to the study of Christian liturgy.

    "He comments, Largely still unexplored Syriac manuscripts provide evidence for the remarkable change of the liturgical rite...The critical study of the contents of the many liturgical books in use in the various Syriac traditions is still very much in its infancy. 14 Given the inchoate nature of research on Syriac liturgies, fundamental questions of cataloguing manuscripts, identifying texts, and recognizing authorial and scribal traditions stand even more at the fore in this sub-field than in the three areas mentioned above, in part because reference works describing Syriac liturgical texts and authors are often incomplete (or even non-existent).Brock concludes by discussing two other major areas of research which stand firmly within the history of Syriac literature: the study of Syriac poetry and the study of Syriac theological literature.

    "These overlapping domains have been studied more than Syriac liturgy; in part out of the interest of scholars in adjacent fields to trace ideas, texts, and influential authors, and in part because of their prominent place within Syriac literature itself.For some Syriac authors, such as Ephrem the Syrian or Philoxenos of Mabbug, scholars have published extensive bibliographies, catalogues of works, and monographs.15 For other authors, especially medieval authors, the full extent of their work has not yet been catalogued.

    "Indeed, until Syriaca.org began to publish author and title information, the most exhaustive resource for identifying authors and works was Anton Baumstark's Geschichte der syrischen Literature (1922), a reference work now nearly a century old.16 Accordingly, even in the study of core areas of Syriac literature one of the most active areas of research is the preliminary work of identifying texts and authors.17Brock's list of primary fields of Syriac research is representative rather than exhaustive; Brock himself has called attention to other areas such as the importance of Syriac Studies to the study of Christian hagiography.18 His vision reflects the traditional focus of the field on Syriac textual sources.

    "The study of Syriac material culture, archaeology, and art history remain at an even earlier stage of scholarship.Moreover, sociological and anthropological analyses of Syriac communities past and present are only a recent development in the field which will hopefully grow further.19 In spite of these limitations, Brock's survey identifies many of the core questions and concepts around which much of the historical scholarship in the field is oriented: the relationships of texts, manuscripts (as expressions or transmissions of the text), persons, places, and themes to each other and to the historiography of the field.

    "Nevertheless, it is important that this research be done with an eye on the further questions that yet open up.Lucas Van Rompay, a senior scholar in the field, has offered the following observation about how the Syriac literary tradition must be studied both in part and in whole:A tradition which has existed for nearly two millennia cannot be studied solely as a linear development gradually unfolding in history, whose constituent elements are continuously being piled up like bricks, forming an ever growing, ever expanding monument.

    "It is in the use of descriptive vocabularies that Syriaca.org has most needed to adapt its use of the Linked Data model to the specific epistemological needs of historical scholarship.Syriaca.org's data is primarily oriented around textual sources; that is, the data is frequently extracted from textual sources or is metadata about such texts (e.g. information about authorship or provenance).Preserving the proximity of the data to the nuance of textual sources is perhaps the primary design value of Syriaca.org.

    "At times the ambiguities of prose make it impossible to encode this data directly into RDF Linked Data without losing some of the semantic value of context in the primary source.When Syriaca.org began to first encode data in the period 2010-2012, the ontologies and data specifications most common on the Web of Data were largely designed for data derived from online networks of friends, governmental data sets, or the natural sciences.74 As Cory Doctorow has noted, these types ontologies are built for data sets which are (naively?) assumed to be uniformly accurate and reliable.75 Such assumptions are simply unworkable for historians whose data is never uniform and is usually derived from ambiguous and even contradictory sources.Since 2012, the work of several networks of historians (the other authors in this volume, for example) have begun to draft useful LOD ontologies for historical data.

    "This emphasis on sourcing has had two influences on the design of the Syriaca.org data model.First, Syriaca.org requires that all data points have the digital equivalent of a footnote indicating information provenance.While data provenance can be indicated with annotations in RDF, its development was somewhat of an afterthought in the development of the Web of Data and remains cumbersome.77 Second, at times prose sources may indicate an unnamed or ambiguous relationship between entities which Syriaca.org might wish to model with Linked Data.

    "For example, two places might be mentioned in a medieval text as both being near a third place but without specificity.While this ambiguous relationship could be modelled somewhat generically in RDF, a historian will likely want to consult the original passage in the historical text for herself since the context may reveal something which cannot be easily encoded.Given these constraints, Syriaca.org needed a base data format better-suited to encoding and annotating historical source texts.This need prompted the project to look beyond the current usage of the Semantic Web for a data format which would allow the Syriaca.org data sets to reuse primary sources.

    "This search was undertaken in the spirit of Linked Data best practices which encourage the reuse of widely shared vocabularies.For the scholarly encoding and analysis of textual and historical data, such a widely-adopted set of terms exists, but it predates the Semantic web and thus is not an RDF vocabulary.This vocabulary is the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI).78 The TEI guidelines are a set of over 500 XML tags which have been curated and defined by a scholarly user community for more than two decades.79 Given the close fit of TEI Guidelines to Syriaca.org's textual data, our approach was to create a hybrid data model which could serialize the structures of Linked Data out of the textual mark-up of the TEI.

    "The resulting serialization stack uses RDF as an interchange format but retains TEI XML as the native data format.All data is authored in TEI XML and then serialized (e.g. generated) into RDF and HTML.The native use of TEI allows the Syriaca.org knowledge graph to document data provenance and cite sources following standard scholar practices of citation.An abbreviated example of this serialization is illustrated as Examples 3 and 4 and Figures 4 and 5 in the appendix.

    "While Syriaca.org's combination of RDF and TEI is perhaps not typical, it is nevertheless compatible with the model of content negotiation at the heart of the Web of Data.As noted in Table 1 above, a request for a document describing URI for the city of Edessa can be filled in three ways.The document served can be an HTML page (for a human with a web browser) or an RDF representation (for a machine query) or the original TEI XML file from which both the HTML and RDF are serialized depending on the preference of the request (for use by either a human editor or an XML API).

    "Ptolemy says After the gap the milk again makes a fresh beginning at the four stars to the rear of the right shoulder of Ophiuchus.The eastern rim of this belt is defined (being just grazed) by the lone brilliant star under the tail of Aquila, while the opposite rim is defined by the star which is some distance to the north of the four just mentioned.35 The set of four stars is comprised of XIII 25, 26, 27, 28 (66, 67, 68 and 70 Oph, respectively).

    "The brilliant star which defines one rim is XVI 9 (u03b6 Aql), and the star that defines the other one is XIII 29 (72 Oph).Ptolemy continues From there on this belt, besides being rarefied, is also contracted into a narrow space in the area which is in advance of the star in the beak of Cygnus, so as to produce the appearance of a gap.However, the remained of it, from the star in the beak up to the star in the breast of Cygnus, is wider and considerably denser.

    "The star in the neck of Cygnus lies in the middle of the dense section. A rarefied section branches off to the north from the star in the breast as far as the star in the shoulder of the right wing and the two stars close together in the right foot.From this point, as we said, occurs a clear gap to the other belt, stretching from the above-mentioned stars in Cygnus up to the bright star in the rump.36 The star in the beak of Cygnus is IX 1 (u03b2 Cyg) and the one in the breast is IX 4 (u03b3 Cyg).

    "This description is both subtle, and accurate.He then says that at this point a much wider and denser region begins, from 7 up to 8.He is referring to the modern Cygnus Star Cloud, one of the most striking features of the Milky Way for modern boreal observers.Star 9 is indeed right in the middle of the star cloud.The following part of the text is not so clear it is possible that Ptolemy was looking at the set of 8, 10 and 11 as the markers of a part of the cloud which has the shape of an inverted Indeed, while 10 and 11 are connected by a soft stripe of the milk, the section between 8 and 12 is clearly occupied by a dark spot.

    "This spot marks, as Ptolemy says, the division between this section of the northern belt, and the much larger and continuous southern belt.Conclusion.A description of the Milky Way is something of a surprising element in a work such as the Almagest.While the rest of the work is devoted to themes which are potentially tractable via precise mathematical tools, in this chapter he is dealing with something that, to an extent, escapes this approach.

    "Here Ptolemy uses the coordinates of stars to locate the limits of the Milky Way, or to point to this or that of its features.But this is only part of the work.Given that the Milky Way has a complex structure, with different densities and variable shapes along its path, Ptolemy has to combine his mathematical skills with qualitative visual descriptions, in order to convey an appropriate image of his subject. Source: The Almagests description of the Milky Way. Gonzalo L. Recio. ISAW Papers 27 (2024)",
    "There is here no theory of the Milky Way, no attempt at investigating its nature.He is aware that he is looking at something that is very apparent even to the casual eye37, and his aim seems to be just to give this phenomenon its proper place within the wider astronomical framework he is developing, by describing it to a certain level of detail and fixing it with respect to the star catalogue he had already given.The mixed nature of the work is comparable to his geographical books, where we can find the subtle descriptions of borders between regions together with the mathematical discussions about, and determinations of, geographical coordinates of many locations.38 The result of this application of dual skills to the Milky Way is, if not superb, at least with some notorious merits.Ptolemy recognized many of the main features of the Milky Way not only the more obvious divisions at Ara and Cygnus, but also possibly the nebulae in Crux and Carina (near the hind legs of the Centaur), the Large Sagittarius Star Cloud, the Great Rift and the Cygnus Star Cloud.

    "The use of stars to determine the limits of the milk and areas of particular interest are, in most cases, very accurate.There are, however, exceptions.To see the most salient discrepancies we must look at the positions Ptolemy indicated for u03c4 and u03c3 Cyg in the CygnusCepheus section, of u03c7 Aur in Auriga, u03c1 Pup and u03bb Vel in the region of Argo.As I repeated throughout the paper, it seems that Ptolemy generally considered the rims of the Milky Way to be located at the level of brightness which Pannekoek labels with a 20.

    "There is, nevertheless, a pattern of deviation from this general value.As the belt gets closer to the center, Ptolemy tends to diminish its width to Pannekoeks value of 30 and even 40.This may have something to do with the fact that there is a high contrast between the very bright clouds in Sagittarius, and the dark clouds which are intertwined with them.Also, it is possible that the low altitude this area had as seen from Alexandria at the time, with the high effect that extinction had because of this, tended to lower the apparent brightness of the region.

    "As we saw in the cases of Lupus and Ara, this should not be discarded.Pannekoek himself points to this difficulty related to altitude It can be seen from this description that Ptolemy did not notice the Coalsack nor the division into two streams in u03b1 Cen, which is understandable given the low altitude of those parts above the Alexandrian horizon.For him the bifurcation only begins in Ara-Norma.
